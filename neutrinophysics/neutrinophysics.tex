\chapter{Phenomenology of particle physics and experimental status}
\label{ch:pheno}

The idea that our universe is composed of very small and indivisible particles is not new, and has its origins in various cultures.
The word \emph{atom}, which is derived from the Greek word \emph{atomos}, also means \emph{unbreakable}.
Currently, the theory that brings together our understanding of matter, the \emph{elementary particles}, and its interactions, the \emph{forces}, is called the Standard Model of Particle Physics (SM).
This model provides a unified picture where the forces between particles are themselves described by the exchange of particles.
Remarkably, the Standard Model succeeds in describing most current experimental data and represents one of the triumph of modern physics.
A brief review of this model is given in the first part of this chapter.

Nevertheless, some questions are still open, for which the SM does not provide answers, as the matter/antimatter asymmetry of the universe, the dark matter nature and the origin of neutrino masses.
In order to account for these observational discrepancies, new physics models have to be investigated.
If a satisfactory theory beyond the Standard Model emerges, it could greatly impact our comprehension of the fundamental mechanisms of the Universe.
In particular, the third one, concerning the mass of neutrinos, is the one which ultimately motivated this PhD, and is therefore particularly described in the second part of this chapter.
It could also have an impact on the comprehension of matter/antimatter asymmetry origin.
The third part of this chapter aims at giving an overview of the current research of a non-standard decay, of which the detector I worked on is a part.



\section{The Standard Model of particle physics}


The Standard Model of particle physics describes the strong, weak and electromagnetic interactions, gauged by the symmetry group $SU(3)_{C}\times SU(2)_{L}\times U(1)_{Y}$, where $C$ represents the colour, $L$ the left-handed chirality and $Y$ the hypercharge.
The SM gauge bosons (the $8$ gluons, $Z_{0}$, $W^{\pm}$ and the photon) mediate these interactions.
The scalar Higgs field is at the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking (i.e. $SU(2)_{L}\times U(1)_{Y} \rightarrow U(1)_{em}$), and is responsible for giving masses to elementary particles.

\subsection{Particle content}

The particle content is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:SM_chart}.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Fermions}

Fermions are particles with half-integer spins, obeying to the Pauli exclusion principle.
The properties of the $12$ fermions of the Standard Model allow to classify them into categories, according to the forces to which they are sensitive.
All fermions experience the weak force, while only $9$ of them participate in the electromagnetic interaction of QED, the neutrinos being electrically neutral.
Only quarks feel the strong force, as they are the only ones carrying the QCD charge.
The SM fermions are further classified in three generations.

To construct the electroweak $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ theory, the fermions field can be represented through their chirality properties.
For one given generation, the left-handed chiral components of the fermion fields are grouped into $SU(2)$ doublets
\begin{equation}
  L_{L}=
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \nu_{L} \\
    l_{L}
  \end{pmatrix}
  \qquad \text{and} \qquad
  q_{L}=
 \begin{pmatrix}
    u_{L} \\
    d_{L}
 \end{pmatrix}
 \,,
 \label{eq:fermion_doublet}
\end{equation}
where $L_L$ stands for the leptons and $q_L$ for the quarks.
The right-handed components of the other fermions are $SU(2)$ singlets, $e_R$, $u_R$ and $d_R$.
In the SM, neutrinos are assumed to have only left-handed components.
The generalisation for three generations is not presented in this chapter.

\subsubsection*{Bosons}

Bosons are particles with integer spins, described by the Bose-Einstein statistics.
The elementary bosons of the SM, also called gauge bosons, have a spin $1$ and mediate the interaction between elementary particles.
The Higgs boson, with a spin $0$, is a scalar boson.

\subsection{Where the Standard Model ends}


An ultimate Model of particle physics should theoretically predict and explain all particle masses and interactions, with few free parameters.
Despite the success of the Standard Model in the explanation of particle behaviours, unanswered questions remain.
\begin{itemize}
\item Matter/antimatter asymmetry\\
  The beginning of the Universe should have produced the same quantity of matter and antimatter, simply because nor matter nor antimatter should be advantaged over the other.
  Nevertheless, from experimental evidences, we know that the former dominates over the latter.
  This is known as the Baryonic Asymmetry of the Universe (BAU).
  The amount of charge-parity (CP) violation observed in the quark sector being not sufficient to explain this asymmetry, the SM fails to explain this unbalance.
\item Dark matter\\
  The known matter described by the SM represents only $5$\% of the Universe composition.
  Another $27$\% represents matter existing in a \emph{non-luminous} form, called Dark Matter (DM), for which the Standard Model does not provide a viable candidate.
  Such matter is colourless and electrically neutral, and can only have weak and/or gravitational interactions.
  Early evidence for the existence of DM was provided by galaxy rotation curves: relying only on \emph{luminous} matter, the velocity should decrease as $r^{-1/2}$, where $r$ is the distance to the galaxy centre.
  This is in disagreement with observation, suggesting the existence of additional matter.
  The remaining $68$\% of the universe composition is dark energy, an unknown form of energy introduced, among others, to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe.
\item Neutrino masses\\
  Providing an explanation to neutrino masses, and understanding their smallness compared to other fermions, is an important question in modern particle physics.
  First proposed by Fermi in $1933$~\cite{art:fermi_1933}, neutrinos were believed to be mass-less, and in its original formulation, the SM included no neutrino mass term.
  Neutrino oscillations, which are confirmed by a plethora of experiments, provided evidence for neutrino masses.
  Given their unique neutral character, neutrinos can be either Dirac (particles and anti-particles are distinct) or Majorana (particles are their own anti-particles) fermions.
  Looking for neutrinoless beta decays is one of the preferred ways to probe the Majorana nature of neutrinos.
\end{itemize}
This is a non-exhaustive list, and other tensions exist between theory and observation, such as the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, or the flavour universality violation in B and D meson decays.


\section{Going beyond the Standard Model with neutrinos}
\subsection{Neutrino flavors and oscillations}

The neutrinos are only detected through their weak interaction with matter, which defines the three neutrino flavours.
For instance, an electron neutrino $\nu_e$ is defined through a charged-current weak interaction of an electron.
In the same manner, the charged-current weak interaction of an electron neutrino produces an electron.

The first (and only) evidence that neutrinos are massive is the observation of neutrino oscillations, first predicted in 1957 by Pontecorvo~\cite{art:pontecorvo_1958}.
In 1998 emerged from the Super-Kamiokande experiment the confirmation for neutrino flavour changing: the deficit of muon neutrinos was inconsistent with expectations based on calculations of the atmospheric neutrino flux, suggesting that muon neutrinos oscillate with tau neutrinos~\cite{art:kamiokande_1998}.

\subsubsection*{Flavour and mass eigenstates}


The neutrino oscillation is a quantum-mechanical effect, which can be understood in terms of the relationship between the three weak interaction eigenstates, $\nu_e$, $\nu_{\mu}$ and $\nu_{\tau}$ that can be experimentally measured, and the three mass eigenstates, $\nu_1$, $\nu_2$ and $\nu_3$, that propagate in space-time.
If the neutrino mass is zero thus, in the charged lepton sector, a basis can always be defined such as the lepton mass matrix is diagonal.
However, by introducing even small masses for the neutrinos, a common basis were the two lepton mass matrix are diagonal can't be found.
The neutrino interaction and mass eigenstate are related by the $U_{PMNS}$ matrix such as
\begin{equation}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \nu_e \\
    \nu_{\mu} \\
    \nu_{\tau}
  \end{pmatrix}
  =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    U_{e1} & U_{e2} & U_{e3} \\
    U_{\mu 1} & U_{\mu 2} & U_{\mu 3} \\
    U_{\tau 1} &  U_{\tau 2} &  U_{\tau 3} \\
  \end{pmatrix}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \nu_1 \\
    \nu_2 \\
    \nu_3
  \end{pmatrix}
  \,,
  \label{eq:upmns}
\end{equation}
where $U_{e2}$ denotes the $\nu_2$-component of the interaction eigenstate $\nu_e$, for instance.

\subsubsection*{Oscillation probability}

Considering two-flavour neutrino $\nu_{\alpha}$ and $\nu_{\beta}$, the oscillation probability is written as
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{P}_{\nu_{\alpha}\rightarrow \nu_{\beta}}(t)=\sin^{2}({2\theta})\sin^{2}\left({\frac{\Delta m^2}{4E}}L\right)\qquad (\nu_{\alpha}\neq\nu_{\beta})
  \label{eq:osc_proba}
\end{equation}
where $L$ is the source-detector distance, $E$ is the neutrino energy and $\theta$ is the mixing angle with a value in the interval ${0\leq\theta\leq\pi/2}$.
In the particular case of two-neutrino mixing the squared mass difference $\Delta m^2$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
\Delta m^2=\Delta m_{12}^2=m_2^2-m_1^2\,,
\end{equation}
where $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of the states $\nu_1$ and $\nu_2$ defined as $m_1<m_2$ so that $\Delta m^2>0$.
The first observation coming with Eq.~\eqref{eq:osc_proba} is that if neutrino masses were not degenerated, oscillations would not be possible.
A direct consequence of this statement is that if neutrinos are mass-less, they cannot oscillate.
Then, we only need two non-zero neutrino masses for neutrino oscillation to be observed.

Neutrino mixing is a quantum effect: an interaction state $\nu_{\alpha}$ is produced in a well-determined state, which is a linear combination of the three mass eigenstates.
When the neutrino propagates through space-time, these coefficient are free to evolve as long as the neutrino is not detected and therefore measured.
The neutrino is then no more determined as $\nu_{\alpha}$.
When the neutrino is detected, an eigenstate is determined in the interaction basis, corresponding to $\nu_e$, $\nu_{\mu}$ or $\nu_{\tau}$.
Thus $\nu_{\alpha}$ can be measured as another neutrino state, with the probability given in Eq.~\eqref{eq:osc_proba}.

\subsubsection*{Neutrinos mass ordering}

The sensitivity to $\Delta m^2$ of an experiment is the value of $\Delta m^2$ for which ${\Delta m^2 L/2E \sim 1}$, allowing to classify neutrino experiments.

Atmospheric neutrinos are created by the interaction between the cosmic rays and the nuclei in the earth's atmosphere: protons of the cosmic rays interact with atmospheric nuclei, mostly producing pions.
Pions mainly decay into muons and muon neutrinos in the energy range of $[0.5-10^2]$~GeV.
Atmospheric neutrino experiments, with a source-detector distance about $10^4$~km, are then sensitive to $\Delta m^2\sim 10^{-4}$~eV$^2$, above the order of magnitude of $\Delta m^2_{32}$ , which allow to rename $\Delta m^2_{32} = \Delta m^2_{atm}$.

In nuclear fusion processes, protons are transformed into neutrons through a weak process, producing electron neutrinos with an energy about $[0.2-15]$~MeV.
Since the sun-earth distance is about $1.5\times 10^{11}$~km, solar neutrino experiments are sensitive to $\Delta m^2 \sim 10^{-12}$~eV$^2$.
Comparing this sensitivity with $\Delta m^2_{12}$, one can write $\Delta m^2_{12} = \Delta m^2_{sol}$.
The study of neutrino mixing allows us to have access to precise values of squared mass differences $\Delta m^2_{sol}$ and $\Delta m^2_{atm}$.

Thanks to matter effects in the Sun, we know that $\Delta m^2_{sol}>0$.
Since $\Delta m^2_{atm}$ is essentially measured via neutrino oscillations in vacuum, which exclusively depend on its absolute value, its sign is unknown at the moment.
Therefore, the neutrino masses can be ordered in two ways: normal ordering (NO) if $\Delta m^2_{atm}>0$ and inverted ordering (IO) if $\Delta m^2_{atm}<0$.
Both orderings are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:IO_NO}.
Indirect constraints may come from the observation of the neutrinoless double beta decay or from cosmological bounds on the sum of the neutrino masses.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Oscillation data}

The leptonic mixing matrix defined in Eq.~\eqref{eq:upmns} can be parameterised as
\begin{equation}
  U_{PMNS}=
  \begin{pmatrix}
    c_{12}c_{13} & s_{12}c_{13} & s_{13}e^{-i\delta_{CP}} \\
    -s_{12}c_{23}-c_{12}s_{23}s_{13}e^{i\delta_{CP}} & c_{12}c_{23}-s_{12}s_{23}s_{13}e^{i\delta_{CP}} & s_{23}c_{13} \\
    s_{12}s_{23}-c_{12}c_{23}s_{13}e^{i\delta_{CP}} &  -c_{12}s_{23}-s_{12}c_{23}s_{13}e^{i\delta_{CP}} &  c_{23}c_{13} \\
  \end{pmatrix}
  \label{eq:upmns_detail}
\end{equation}
where $c_{ij}=\cos{\theta_{ij}}$, $s_{ij}=\sin{\theta_{ij}}$ and $\delta_{CP}$ is the Dirac CP violating phase.
Tab.~\ref{tab:best_fit} sums up the latest best fit values of $U_{PMNS}$ parameters~\cite{art:Capozzi_2017}.

Fig.~\ref{fig:ckm_pmns} pictures the relative different contributions of quark and neutrino matrix elements.
Unlike the CKM matrix for the quark sector, the neutrino mixing angles are found to be large.
%% This can be explained by the different forces to which quarks and neutrinos are sensitive.
%% Indeed, whenever the interaction eigenstates are not equal to the mass eigenstates, particles can experience oscillations.
%% Experimentally, whether or not these oscillations are observable depends on the interactions of the particles.
%% Quarks interact significantly with their environment, meaning they are often measured and thus determined in a given interaction state.
%% Therefore, quark oscillations exist but are highly reduced.
%% On the other hand, neutrinos interact very little when they propagate, thus their oscillations are experimentally measurable.

\subsection{Neutrino masses and nature}


As neutrinos are neutral particles, several mass terms can be introduced in the SM Lagrangian, depending on their nature.

\subsubsection{Neutrino Dirac masses}
\label{subsec:dirac_mass}

In the SM, fermions are Dirac particles, meaning particles and anti-particles are different.
Their masses arise with the Higgs mechanism, through the coupling of left- and right-handed fields with the Higgs doublet.
One can imagine the same mechanism arises for neutrinos.

In the SM, only left handed leptons participate in the charged weak interaction.
As it is the only force through which neutrinos interact, only the left-handed component is described in the SM for neutrinos.
Then, adding a Dirac term in the Lagrangian comes with introducing a right-handed chiral neutrino field, so-called sterile neutrino.
They are named that way in order to distinguish them from known left-handed active neutrinos.

\subsubsection*{Dirac spinors}

In the Standard Model, fermions are described by Dirac quantised fields $\psi(x)$, 4-component spinors which are a solution of the Dirac equation,
\begin{equation}
  (i\slashed\partial-m)\psi(x)=0\,,
  \label{eq:dirac}
\end{equation}
with $m$ the mass of charged leptons.
$\slashed\partial\equiv \gamma^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}$ where there is an implied summation over the values of the twice-repeated index $\mu=0,1,2,3$, and $\partial_{\mu}$ is the $4$-gradient.
We can describe a Dirac field in term of chiral fields as
\begin{equation}
  \psi = \psi_R + \psi_L\,,
  \label{eq:chiral}
\end{equation}
with $\psi_R$ and $\psi_L$ the eigenvectors of the $\gamma^{5}$ chirality projector matrix.
$\psi_R$ and $\psi_L$ are called Weyl spinors.
Then the Lagrangian for a free fermion field is written as
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = (\overline{\psi_R} + \overline{\psi_L})(i\overleftrightarrow{\slashed{\partial}}-m)(\psi_R + \psi_L)\,.
\end{equation}
It results from Eqs.~\eqref{eq:dirac} and \eqref{eq:chiral} that $\psi_R$ and $\psi_L$ have independent kinetic terms, but coupled mass terms:
\begin{align}
i\gamma^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}\psi_L& = m\psi_R\,,\label{eq:psi_L}\\
i\gamma^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}\psi_R& = m\psi_L\,\label{eq:psi_R}\,.
\end{align}
Consequently, the two chiral component fields are independent only if $m = 0$.

%% \subsection{$\twonu$ decay}

\subsubsection*{Dirac mass term}

Charged leptons are massive in the SM with the Dirac mass term in the Lagrangian:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}^{l}_{Y} = -\frac{v}{\sqrt{2}}\,\overline{l}_{L}\,Y^{l}\,l_{R} + h.c.\,,
\end{equation}
where $Y^{l}$ is the Yukawa matrix for charged leptons, and $v$ is the vacuum expectation value (vev) for the Higgs field.
In the SM Lagrangian, there is no mass term for neutrinos, and the lepton Yukawa couplings can be diagonalised without leading to flavour violation in charged lepton currents.
Thus the lepton flavour is conserved in the SM.

In the Standard Model, neutrinos only undergo weak interactions.
But weak interactions are described by the $SU(2)_L$ group, whose elements act only on left-handed chiral components of the fermion fields.
So weak interaction ``see'' only the LH components of fields.
If one goes beyond the SM, one can add a right handed neutrino $\nu_R$, singlet under all gauge interactions ($SU(3)_{C}\times SU(2)_{L}\times U(1)_{Y}$ gauge groups).
In this case, and as occurred for the quark and charged lepton sectors, neutrino masses can be generated by the Higgs mechanism, with a Dirac mass term:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}^{\nu}_{Y} = -\frac{v}{\sqrt{2}}\,\overline{\nu}_{L}\,Y^{\nu}\,\nu_{R} + h.c.\,.
\label{eq:dirac_mass_term}
\end{equation}
Thus to have a Dirac mass term in the Lagrangian, we need to introduce right handed neutrinos $\nu_R$, called sterile neutrinos, because they do not interact through weak interaction, unlike active neutrinos.
If neutrinos and leptons are both massive, one cannot have $Y^\nu$ and $Y^l$ simultaneously diagonal.
Then the leptonic charged currents are not diagonal anymore, leading to lepton flavour violation.
That leads to new processes including neutrino oscillations.

It is important to notice that for Dirac neutrinos, and even if their masses are described by the same mechanism responsible for all other SM fermion masses, the corresponding Yukawa couplings are extremely tiny, many orders of magnitude below $Y^l$ and $Y^q$ (the Yukawa matrix for quarks).

\subsubsection{Neutrino Majorana masses}
\label{subsec:maj_mass}

\subsubsection*{Majorana neutrinos}

As we have seen in the previous sub-section, $4$-component Dirac spinors are used to describe fermion fields.
As Eqs.~\eqref{eq:psi_L} and~\eqref{eq:psi_R} are coupled, we could derive one simple expression if we find a link between $\psi_R$ and $\psi_L$.
In the $1930$'s Ettore Majorana suggested such a link by writing $\psi_R = C\overline{\psi}_L^{\,T}$, where $C$ is the charge conjugation matrix and $\overline{\psi} = \gamma^0\psi$.
Therefore $C\overline{\psi}_L^{\,T}$ is right-handed.
We thus have the Majorana condition for fields
\begin{equation}
  \psi=C\overline{\psi}^{\,T}\,,
  \label{eq:maj_cond}
\end{equation}
since we have the chiral description for fermion fields in Eq.~\eqref{eq:chiral}.
With this condition, fermion fields are now described by a $2$-component spinor.
Thus a Majorana field has half the number of degree of freedom of a Dirac field.
As $C\overline{\psi}_L^{\,T}$ is equivalent to $\psi_{L}^{C}$~\cite{book:giunti}, the Majorana condition in Eq.~\eqref{eq:maj_cond} can be written as $\psi = \psi^C$.
This further implies that a Majorana particle is its own antiparticle.
Therefore, Majorana and Dirac particles are fundamentally different particles.

\subsubsection*{Majorana mass term}

An effective field theory (EFT) is an ``approximation'' of a more general theory.
It is used when a physical process is studied at such low energies (or long distances) that we cannot probe the underlying phenomenon that occurs (one says that the heavy fields at the origin of such
interactions are ``integrated out'').
Fermi first described the weak interaction of beta decay with an EFT, when only leptons and hadrons were known.
This so-called Fermi theory describes a contact interaction between $4$ SM fields.
In a more general manner, an effective Lagrangian, which generalises the SM one, has an infinite number of terms as
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L}_{eff}=\mathcal{L}_{SM}+\sum_{d}\frac{1}{\Lambda^{d-4}}C^{d}O^{d}\,,
\end{equation}
with $d>4$.
$C$ represents the couplings at the effective vertex, and $O$ is an effective non-renormalisable operator with a dimension above $4$, which contains only SM fields.
For the neutrino case, we want to write a mass term involving only SM fields, that means with the only left-handed neutrino field $\nu_L$.
The operator with the lowest dimension - which respects the SM symmetries - to describe neutrino masses in the SM (without RH neutrinos) is a dimension-$5$ operator, called the Weinberg operator, which can be represented as in Fig.~\ref{fig:weinberg_diagram} and defined as
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L}_5 = \frac{1}{2}\frac{g^{eff}}{\mathcal{M}}(\overline{L}_{L}^{\,c}\sigma^{2}\phi)(\phi^{\,T}\sigma^{2}L_L)+h.c.\,,
  \label{eq:lag_5}
\end{equation}
where $g^{eff}$ is a dimensionless coefficient corresponding to a new effective coupling and $\sigma$ the Pauli matrices.
$L_L$ is defined by Eq.~\eqref{eq:fermion_doublet} and $\phi$ represents the Higgs field.
In Eq.~\eqref{eq:lag_5}, the coefficient $C$ is here identified with $g^{eff}/2$, and $O$ is represented by the [LH][LH] operator.
This Lagrangian respects all the SM symmetries, except for the total lepton number conservation.
After the electroweak symmetry breaking, the following Lagrangian stands for the neutrino fields
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L}_5=\frac{1}{2}\frac{g^{eff}v^{2}}{\mathcal{M}}\overline{\nu}^{\,c}_{L}\nu_{L}+h.c.\,,
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{M}$ denotes a mass scale at which new degrees of freedom arise, corresponding to new physics.
A Majorana mass term for neutrinos can be defined as
\begin{equation}
m_{\nu}=\frac{g^{eff}v^{2}}{\mathcal{M}}\,.
\label{eq:mass_maj}
\end{equation}
The dimension-$5$ operator in Eq.~\eqref{eq:lag_5} is not renormalisable.
Nevertheless, it is natural to think that the actual SM theory is not the final theory, but an effective theory, as a reminiscence of a more complete one.
Neutrino masses can then be seen as a low energy manifestation of this physics beyond the Standard Model.
There exist many other higher dimension operators, for example, the Fermi operator is a dimension-6 effective operator, as are the operators responsible for charged lepton flavour violation.
Notice that the higher the dimension is, the harder is the observation of the corresponding new physics effects.

\subsubsection{Neutrino mass term}

In the two previous sub-sections the Dirac and Majorana nature of neutrinos were reviewed.
Assuming a right-handed chiral field exists, it is possible to combine the Dirac and Majorana descriptions.
A Dirac-Majorana mass term is derived for one generation of neutrinos, for the minimal model where an additional right-handed neutrino is added to the particle content.


\subsubsection*{Dirac-Majorana mass term}

After Eq.~\eqref{eq:dirac_mass_term}, a Dirac mass term for neutrinos in the Lagrangian can be defined as
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L}_D=-m_D\overline{\nu}_L\nu_R+h.c.\,,
  \label{eq:lag_dirac}
\end{equation}
with $m_D=\frac{v}{\sqrt{2}}y^{\,\nu}$ in the case of one generation of neutrinos, where $y^{\nu}$ embeds the Yukawa coupling.
In addition, one can define a Majorana mass term for the right-handed neutrino field as
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L}_R=\frac{1}{2}m_R\overline{\nu}_{R}^{\,c}\nu_{R}+h.c.\,,
\end{equation}
with $m_R$ defined in the same manner as in Eq.~\eqref{eq:mass_maj}.
Thus, in general, it is possible to have a Dirac-Majorana mass term in the Lagrangian:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{D+M}=\mathcal{L}_D+\mathcal{L}_R=-m_{D}\overline{\nu}_L\nu_R+\frac{1}{2}m_R\overline{\nu}_{R}^{\,c}\nu_{R}+h.c.\,.
\end{equation}
This term can be re-written as
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L}_{D+M}=\frac{1}{2}n_L^TC^{\dagger}\mathbb{M}n_L+h.c.\,.
\end{equation}
with $n_L=(\nu_L \nu_R^{c})^{T}$, and the non-diagonal matrix

\begin{equation}
\mathbb{M}=
\begin{pmatrix}
  0 & m_D \\
  m_D & m_{R}
\end{pmatrix}
\,.
\end{equation}
For one generation of neutrinos, $\mathbb{M}$ is a $(2\times 2)$ matrix.
In the more general case of three generations, $m_D$ and $m_R$ are $(3 \times 3)$ diagonal matrices.
The matrix $\mathbb{M}$ has to be diagonalised in order to have masses for $\nu_R$ and $\nu_L$.
$\mathbb{M}$ is diagonalised by $U^T\mathbb{M}U$ with $U$ the mixing matrix from interaction to mass basis
\begin{equation}
  U =
\begin{pmatrix}
  \cos{\theta} & \sin{\theta} \\
  -\sin{\theta} & \cos{\theta}
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
  \eta_{1} & 0 \\
  0 & \eta_{2}
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
with $\eta_{1}$ and $\eta_{2}$ two phases called Majorana phases, ensuring that masses, eigenvalues of $\mathbb{M}$, are positive.
Thus, after diagonalisation, we have the two masses
\begin{equation}
m_{1,2}=\frac{1}{2}\left(m_R\mp\sqrt{m_R^{2}+4m_{D}^{2}}\right)\eta^{2}_{1,2}\,,
\end{equation}
with $\eta_{1}=i$ and $\eta_{2}=1$.
Here we note the role of Majorana phases: $\eta_{1}$ guarantees the positiveness of the $m_{1}$ solution.
Other models, including a Majorana mass term $m_L$ for the $\nu_L$ field exist, and allow to describe pure Dirac or pure Majorana conditions.


\subsubsection*{See-saw mechanisms}

The Standard Model forbids a mass term for the $\nu_L$ field but predicts nothing for the $\nu_R$ field.
Considering the case were $m_D \ll m_R$ (and $m_L=0$) would allow to explain how neutrinos acquire their small masses, through the see-saw mechanism.
Indeed, the two mass eigenstates can be re-written as
\begin{equation}
  m_1\simeq \frac{m_D^2}{m_R} \qquad \text{and} \qquad m_2\simeq m_R\,.
\end{equation}
If a large value is considered for $m_R$ and a small one for $m_D$, the light neutrino has a mass $m_1$ corresponding to the observed active one, while the heavy neutrino has a mass $m_2$ and corresponds to the sterile singlet.
This realisation of the see-saw mechanism is the best known, but others exist.

To introduce a Weinberg operator, leading to a Majorana mass term in the Lagrangian, one can consider the most general form $[L H L H]$, composed of Higgs fields $H$ and lepton fields $L$, and try to combine it in order to have gauge invariant operators.
\begin{itemize}
\item It is possible to combine lepton and Higgs fields to have an $SU(2)$ fermion singlet.
  The corresponding Feynman diagram is represented in Fig.~\ref{subfig:diagram_seesawI}.
  This realisation of the see-saw mechanism was already presented above, where one RH neutrino field gives rise to a mass for one LH neutrino field.
  In that case, the addition of three RH fields to the model would be sufficient to give masses to the three active neutrinos.
\item We can also consider a combination giving a heavy scalar triplet ${\xi = (\xi^{++},\xi^{+},\xi^{0})}$.
  The corresponding Feynman diagram is presented in Fig.~\ref{subfig:diagram_seesawII}.
  This is a mechanism which does not require right-handed neutrinos.
\item The last way to combine lepton and Higgs fields in order to have a gauge invariant Lagrangian consists in introducing a fermionic triplet ${\Sigma = (\Sigma^{+},\Sigma^{0},\Sigma^{-})}$, not to be confused with the baryon of the same name.
  The Feynman diagram is pictured in Fig.~\ref{subfig:diagram_seesawIII}.
\end{itemize}
These three possibilities are in fact the only possible realisations to obtain the effective Weinberg operator, using only renormalisable interactions.
They correspond to the so-called type I~\cite{Minkowski_1977}, II~\cite{Ernest_1998} and III~\cite{Marshak_1980} seesaw mechanisms, respectively.

\subsection{Double beta decays}
\label{subsec:double_beta_decays}


Even though it is not protected by a symmetry, the total lepton number is conserved in the SM.
If the neutrino is found to be a Majorana particle it could open leads for the explanation of lepton number violation (LNV), the small masses of the neutrinos through the see-saw mechanism and the matter/antimatter asymmetry in the Universe through Leptogenesis.
The neutrino mass term leads to LNV with $\Delta L = 2$, and the best known process able to probe it is neutrinoless double beta decay~\cite{art:Drewes_2013}.



\subsubsection*{Standard double beta decay}

Let us first introduce the double beta decay proposed by Goeppert-Mayer in $1935$~\cite{art:goeppert_1935} as
\begin{equation}
(A,Z)\rightarrow (A,Z+2)+2e^{-}+2\overline{\nu}_{e}\,,
\end{equation}
describing two simultaneous $\beta$ decays of two nucleons of the same nucleus.
This decay is physically possible for nuclei with an even-even number of nucleons, for whose a simple beta decay would not be favourable: the energy of the daughter nucleus would be higher than the parent one (see Fig.~\ref{fig:2nu_even_odd}).
In some cases (as the $^{48}$Ca nucleus) the simple $\beta$ decay is suppressed because of transition spin considerations.
The double beta decay is then strongly suppressed, which makes it the rarest known nuclear decay.
It is allowed by the Standard Model for $35$ isotopes, and despite its rarity, has already been observed for numerous of them like \Mo, \Se, $^{136}$Xe and $^{76}$Ge, with typical half-lives ranging from $10^{18}$ to $10^{24}$~years.
The Feynman diagram illustrating this process is given in Fig.~\ref{fig:2nu_diagram}.

\subsubsection*{Neutrinoless double beta decay}

In $1939$, Furry proposed the double beta decay without neutrino production as
\begin{equation}
(A,Z)\rightarrow (A,Z+2)+2e^{-}\,,
\end{equation}
in which two neutrons simultaneously decay into protons~\cite{art:furry_1939}.

The existence of such a decay would have deep implications for various physics research.
Firstly, as neutrinos are not emitted, this process implies the violation of the total lepton number by $2$ units, thus making it forbidden in the SM.
However, the lepton number conservation results from an accidental symmetry breaking of the SM, and thus its violation would not necessarily imply Physics beyond the Standard Model.
But more than the LNV, the $\zeronu$ would violate also the baryon - lepton number (B-L) which, on the contrary, is a fundamental symmetry of the SM.
Hence such observation would have major contribution for theories trying to explain the matter/antimatter asymmetry of the Universe.
Moreover, the $\zeronu$ process is allowed only if neutrinos are massive Majorana particles.
Therefore, the observation of this decay would point to the existence of a process that violates a fundamental symmetry of the Standard Model of Particle Physics, and would allow to establish the nature of neutrinos.

At the moment, no experiment has observed $\zeronu$ processes, but various experiments, of which a non-exhaustive list is given in Sec.~\ref{sec:0nu_exp}, have lead to precise limits on $\zeronu$ half-life of $10^{25}-10^{26}$~years.
The future generation of $\zeronu$ experiment is currently under construction.

The underlying mechanism through which the neutrinoless double beta decay would occur is not known, and several theories have been developed.
The most spread one is the exchange of light Majorana RH neutrinos, including dimension-$5$ operator, but other theories are described.
\begin{itemize}
\item Higher dimensional operators: it is possible to consider higher dimension operators (dimension $6$ and $9$ for instance), that are effective and non-renormalisable, respecting the gauge symmetry ${SU(3)_C\times SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y}$.
\item Heavy neutrino exchange considers the case where a heavy RH neutrino is exchanged during the $\zeronu$ decay.
  This was historically the first case to be considered, including a dimension-$9$ operator, with constraints on the heavy neutrino mass coming from the mixing between left-handed neutrinos and the heavy neutrino.
\item Right-handed currents include new RH gauge bosons $W_R$ of a new $SU(2)_R$ gauge group.
  The corresponding operator would be of dimension-$9$ and highly suppressed, by $4$ powers of the masses of the new gauge bosons.
\end{itemize}
If the $\zeronu$ decay is observed, the underlying mechanism through it occurs would have to be determined.
In Fig.~\ref{fig:0nu_diagram} is given the Feynman diagram of the neutrinoless double $\beta$ decay for the light Majorana neutrino exchange realisation.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Experimental search for $\zeronu$}

One of the experimental observable of the double $\beta$ decays is the total energy spectrum of the $2$ emitted electrons, given in Fig.~\ref{fig:bb_energy}.
The $\twonu$ decay emits $4$ leptons, the two electrons having an energy continuum between $0$ and $\Qbb$, the total available energy of the reaction.
In the case of the $\zeronu$ decay, the two electrons would bring the total energy of the reaction, thus the expected signature would be an energy peak at $\Qbb$.

If existing, the $\zeronu$ decay would be an extremely rare process.
The decay rate of the light Majorana exchange is given by:
\begin{equation}
  (T_{1/2}^{0\nu})^{-1} = g_{A}^{4}G^{0\nu}|M^{0\nu}|^{2}\left\lvert\dfrac{m_{\beta\beta}}{m_{e}}\right\rvert^{2}\,,
\end{equation}
where $G^{0\nu}$ is the phase space factor embedding the influence of the Coulomb field of the daughter nucleus on the emitted electrons/positrons.
$M^{0\nu}$ is called the nuclear matrix element embedding the nuclear structure effects of the decaying nucleus.
$m_{\beta\beta}$ is the effective neutrino mass defined as
\begin{equation}
  \langle \mbb \rangle = \left\vert \sum_{i=1...3}m_{i}U^{2}_{ei} \right\vert \,,
\end{equation}
is summed over the three mass eigenstates.
This effective mass depends on the $U_{PMNS}$ matrix elements given in Eq~\eqref{eq:upmns_detail}, and thus is a function of the CP violating phases and of the mass ordering.

\section{$\zeronu$ experimental status}
\label{sec:0nu_exp}

The $\zeronu$ decay has theoretically been proposed.
Various experiments are searching for it, with various technologies, considering the experimental constraints coming with each technique.

\subsection{Experimental design criteria}

As no neutrinos are emitted in a $\zeronu$ decay, the minimal observable in direct searches for $\zeronu$ decay is the total energy of the two emitted electrons.
In that case the signature of a $\zeronu$ signal is an excess of events, compared to the expected background noise, in the total energy spectrum, near the $\Qbb$ released energy.
The width of this peak depends on the energy resolution of the detector.
Depending on experiment designs and purposes, individual electron energies and tracks also represent interesting observables.


The sensitivity to the $\zeronu$ half-life $\Tbeta$ of a given experiment is detailed in Chapter~\ref{ch:sensitivity}, but a brief overview is given.
It depends on the amount of enriched $\beta\beta$ source isotope of the experiment (with $M$ its molar mass), as well as on its natural abundance $a$, on the detector efficiency $\epsilon$, and on the data acquisition time $t$.
%% Research for the $\zeronu$ signal involves optimising a \emph{region of interest} (ROI), also depending on the energy resolution.
%% The total number of events $N^{0\nu}$ occurring in the ROI and in the measurement time $t$, for a detector with an detection efficiency $\epsilon$, using a source isotope of $W$ atomic molar mass and $a$ isotopic abundance, is defined as
%% \begin{equation}
%%   N^{0\nu}=\ln(2)\frac{\mathcal{N}_{A}}{W}\left(\frac{a\epsilon M t}{\Tbeta}\right)\,\text{,}
%%   \label{eq:Nevents}
%% \end{equation}
%% where $\mathcal{N}_{A}$ is the Avogadro number.
%% If no excess of events is observed, the limit set on the $\zeronu$ decay half-life is
%% \begin{equation}
%%   T_{1/2}^{0\nu\text{,lim}}=\ln(2)\frac{\mathcal{N}_{A}}{W}\left(\frac{a\epsilon M t}{N_{\text{exc}}}\right)\,\text{,}
%%   \label{eq:Tlim}
%% \end{equation}
%% $N_{\text{exc}}$ being the number of $\zeronu$ events excluded at a given confidence level in the
%% ROI.
The number of background events highly impacts this sensitivity, as
\begin{equation}
  T_{1/2}^{0\nu\text{,lim}} \propto \left\{
  \begin{array}{ll}
    a M \epsilon t & \text{if no background is expected,} \\
    a \epsilon \sqrt{\frac{M t}{B \Delta E}} & \text{with background}\,,
  \end{array}
  \right.
  \label{eq:sensitivity_background}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta E$ is the energy resolution and $B$ is the background rate usually expressed in $\Bckunit$, taking into account the energy range considered for the $\zeronu$ search, the source mass, and the observation time.
The advantage of a background free experiment clearly comes out: the $\zeronu$ half life would increase linearly with the time of exposure $t$, while following a $\sqrt t$ law for an experiment with a non-negligible number of background events.
Then, it is clear that the control and the discrimination of background is of high priority for such $\zeronu$ direct search experiments.

As experiments aim at reaching the highest possible half-life sensitivities, choices have to be made concerning detector designs.
An ideal isotope would have a high natural abundance and would be deployed with the highest mass possible in a detector with a high detection efficiency, a good energy resolution (small $\Delta E$) under low-background conditions (small $B$).
Of all the $35$ isotopes capable of disintegrating through $\twonu$, none meets all the previous conditions.
Experimenters will then have to find compromises, which are at the origin of the different detection strategies.

In the following, we detail different detection technologies, using either active source (the source is also the detector), or passive source (the source is decoupled from the detection volume).


\subsection{$\zeronu$ direct search experiments}
\label{sec:zeronuexp}
\subsubsection{Semiconductors}
\label{subsec:semiconductors}
Various semiconductor technologies are employed in the detection of $\zeronu$ decay.
The $^{76}$Ge $\beta\beta$ emitter ($\Qbb=2039$ keV) is historically important as it has been adopted since the 1960s in $\zeronu$ decay searches, acting as active source, which enhances the detection efficiency.
$^{76}$Ge-enriched high purity Germanium detectors (HPGe) offer both high energy resolution and extremely high radiopurity (as impurities are removed in the crystal growing process).
These characteristics allow, once external background contribution is minimised, to reach high sensitivity on $\zeronu$ decay, which makes this category of detectors one of the most promising for ton-scale experiments.
Since the last generation (IGEX and Heidelberg-Moscow), HPGe detectors had been improved to reach an ultra low background rate, making way for the current generation of $\zeronu$ detectors -- GERDA, MAJORANA demonstrator and LEGEND.

\paragraph{GERDA} experiment~\cite{art:NEXT_2018} (GERmanium Detector Array) is located at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS), Italy.
GERDA phase I was running from $2011$ to $2013$ with $17.8$ kg of enriched active source detectors from the HEIDELBERG-MOSCOW and IGEX experiments.
Its first aim was to put to the test the controversial result of HEIDELBERG-MOSCOW experiment given in $2001$, announcing the first evidence for $\zeronu$ signal at a $4.2\sigma$ confidence level.
With an exposure of $21.6$ kg.y, the absence of signal in the GERDA-I experiment refuted the previous result, setting a limit $\Tbeta>2.1\, 10^{25}$ y.
Since $2015$, the GERDA experiment is in the second phase (see Fig.~\ref{fig:GERDA}), with a total of $35.8$ kg enriched detectors, $20$ kg of which is Broad Energy Germanium (BEGe) detectors that have been deployed for GERDA-II, providing a better energy resolution and pulse shape discrimination.
The active source is deployed inside a liquid Argon (LAr) augmented with light sensors, acting as an active external shield as well as a cooling down system.
The total is surrounded by a water tank.
The underground laboratory provides $3500$ m water equivalent to reduce the external cosmic background.
The aim is to reach a $10^{26}$ y sensitivity with $100$ kg.y exposure, and a background rate less than $10^{-3}$ $\Bckunit$.
In $2020$, a combined analysis for GERDA phases I and II has resulted in a half-life limit of $\Tbeta>1.8\times 10^{26}$~years ($90$\% C.L.) under the no signal hypothesis, with a total exposure of $127.2$~kg.y~\cite{art:GERDA_2020}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=10cm]{neutrinophysics/fig_neutrinophysics/GERDA.png}
  \caption{Scheme of the GERDA experiment.
    \label{fig:GERDA}}
\end{figure}


\paragraph{MAJORANA demonstrator}~\cite{art:MAJORANA_2014} is an array of enriched germanium detectors searching for the $\zeronu$ decay of the $^{76}$Ge isotope, using High Purity Germanium (HPGe) detectors.
The Majorana Demonstrator is located at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) in Lead, USA.
It is composed of $58$ HPGe detectors divided into $2$ cryostats with $7$ strings each.
Each string is an assembly of $3$, $4$ or $5$ detectors.
The total mass of HPGe crystals is $44.1$~kg, $29.7$~kg of which is enriched to $88$\% $^{76}$Ge.
The observed lower limit is $\Tbeta>2.7\times 10^{25}$~years at $90$\% CL~\cite{art:majorana2019}.
A combined limit from the two Ge-based experiments GERDA and MAJORANA would exceed $10^{26}$~years.

\paragraph{LEGEND} stands for Large Enriched Germanium Experiment for Neutrinoless Double-Beta Decay~\cite{proc:LEGEND_2019}.
After the encouraging results of the MAJORANA Demonstrator and GERDA, the LEGEND collaboration has been formed to pursue a tonne-scale $^{76}$Ge experiment, with discovery potential at a half-life beyond $10^{28}$~years.
The collaboration aim to use existing material from GERDA, especially the cryostat, and perform additional R\&D to build the detector.

\subsection{Bolometers}
\label{subsec:bolometers}

Bolometers are high energy resolution (few keV) and high detection efficiency calorimeters operating at low temperatures ($\simeq 10-20$ mK), by measuring the heat increase, quantified by phonons, generated by particles interaction in the crystal.
The crystals are both the source and the detector, which is particularly suitable for $\zeronu$ searches, and provides the possibility to build large-scale experiments.
As the two electrons topology is not available, analyses of the pulse shapes can be performed in order to discriminate the signal from the electronics noise and the natural radioactivity events.

\paragraph{CUORE} for Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events~\cite{art:CUORE_2019}, is an experiment based at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in Italy.
The feasibility of the project has been proved by Cuoricino, the pilot experiment taking data from $2003$ to $2008$ with $62$ TeO$2$ cryogenic detectors, for a total of $19.75$~kg.y exposure, achieving a lower limit of $\Tbeta>2.8\times 10^{24}$~years at $90$\% CL.
The next step towards the final experiment CUORE is CUORE-$0$ which aims at improving the background reduction.
The data took place from $2013$ to summer $2015$, showing the $\alpha$ background were reduced by a factor $6$.
The final CUORE detector consists of an array of $988$ TeO$2$ crystals arranged in a cylindrical structure of $19$ towers.
The first results of the CUORE experiment had been published in $2018$, where no evidence for $\zeronu$ were found.
Combining their results with the earlier experiments Cuoricino and CUORE-$0$, a lower limit of $\Tbeta>1.5\times 10^{25}$~years at $90$\% CL were achieved.
Latest results of the CUORE collaboration in $2020$ reported a sensitivity of $\Tbeta>1.7\times 10^{25}$~years~\cite{art:CUORE_2020}.


\paragraph{CUPID} for CUORE Upgrade with Particle IDentification~\cite{art:CUPID_2015}, uses the expertise acquired with the CUORE facility, with a background level improved by a factor $100$ as the particle identification is a powerful tool for background rejection.
This technology uses scintillating bolometers, and is based on the principle that different particles produce different amount of light, providing a good discrimination between $\gamma$ and $\alpha$ background events.
The first CUPID-$0$ detector uses $24$ crystals enriched at $95$\% with \Se, for a total mass of $5.17$~kg, coupled with $31$ Germanium light detectors.
It is hosted in the CUORE-$0$ cryostat at LNGS.
With an exposure of $9.95$~kg.y, the CUPID-$0$ collaboration presented the first results with a lower limit of $\Tbeta>3.5\times 10^{24}$~years at $90$\% CL.
These are encouraging for the next CUPID project by showing a high $\alpha$ rejection.
The \Se\ material is however not suitable for CUPID, making the crystal growth complicated and showing a high internal contamination in natural isotopes.
The next project CUPID-Mo was commissioned in $2019$ and is already taking data at Laboratoire Souterrain de Modane in France, with $210$~g of $Li_2^{100}$MoO$_4$ crystals, divided into $5$ towers of $4$ modules each (see Fig.~\ref{fig:CUPID-Mo}).
Preliminary results have been presented and show a high energy resolution (about $5$~keV FWHM), a good $\gamma/\alpha$ discrimination, and a high internal radiopurity, demonstrating that the CUPID technology is ton-scalable.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Time projection chambers}
\label{subsec:TPC}

Time Projection Chambers (TPC) detectors use a medium producing two ways to measure the electron energies: a \emph{scintillation} (ultra-violet light) prompt signal, and a \emph{ionisation} delayed signal.
When a particle crosses the detector, a scintillation light is emitted, the energy of the scintillation peak depending on the medium.
Scintillation photons, travelling at speed of light in the medium, are detected by photo-sensors, giving the \emph{zero-time} of the event.
The crossing particle ionises the medium all along its way, creating electrons drifting to a collection system (an electric field is applied between cathode and anode), allowing the precise measurement of the electron production location in a 2D plane.
The drift time measurement gives access to the third coordinate of the interaction point.
Therefore, combining the two consecutive signals allows precise position and energy reconstructions.
%% A discriminating observable is the ionisation-to-scintillation ratio (see Fig.~\ref{fig:ratio_EXO-200}) as it provides particle discrimination between $\alpha$ particles (low ratio) and $\gamma$ radiations and $\beta$ particles (high ratio).
For $\zeronu$ searches, $^{136}$Xe-enriched isotope in liquid phase is often used, offering a maximal source density (more compact detectors) and a good position resolution.
Unfortunately, the energy resolution is worse than that of the gas-phase TPCs detectors\footnote{Two-phase liquid-Xenon detectors are developed for Dark Matter searches and could be exploited for $\zeronu$ direct searches with the DARWIN project.}.
Noble elements are natural radiation detectors, avoiding the need for excess materials that could generate extra radioactive backgrounds.
$^{136}$Xe-enriched is the only noble element capable to $\twonu$ decay, with $\Qbb=2457.8$ keV.
This isotope has a relatively high natural abundance ($9$\%) and can be enriched to highly pure concentrations, making it interesting for large-scale TPCs $\zeronu$ experiments.

\paragraph{EXO-$200$} experiment~\cite{art:EXO200_2012} is a prototype of the Enriched Xenon Observatory (EXO) project, currently operating in a room under an overburden of $1624$ m.w.e, at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), USA.
The detector is shaped as a cylinder, with two back-to-back cylindrical TPCs.
A high negative voltage grid cathode holds at the mid plane of the detector ($40$ cm diameter), and two anodes are located on both sides, at ground potential.
A cross-section of the detector is displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:EXO-200}.
The detector is held at $167$ K in a cryogenic bath.
With $110$ kg of enriched $^{136}$Xe in liquid phase, the phase I of this TPC detector has measured for the first time the Xenon $\twonu$ decay with $\Tbeta=2.165\times 10^{21}$ y.
Between phase I and IIa, the detector was upgraded with improved low-noise electronics, a Radon suppression system, and the impurities contents of the Xenon were reduced by a factor ten.
The current detector performance shows an energy resolution of $2.90$\% (FWHM) at the decay $Q$-value and a background rate of $1.6\times 10^{-3}\Bckunit$.
EXO-$200$ phase IIa data placed a new limit of $\Tbeta>1.8\times 10^{25}$ y ($90$\% C.L.).
The final analysis allowed to reach $5.0\times 10^{25}$~years at $90$\% CL with a $234.1$~kg.y exposure~\cite{art:EXO200_2019}.

  \caption{Cross-section of the EXO-$200$ TPC detector
    \label{fig:EXO-200}}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{nEXO}~\cite{unknown:nEXO_2018} is the successor of EXO-$200$ searching for the $\zeronu$ decay of $^{136}$Xe with a target half-life sensitivity of $\sim 10^{28}$~years using $5\times 10^3$~kg of enriched liquid-xenon in a time projection chamber.
This limit would be reached by using an increased mass of enriched $^{136}$Xe, and an active R\&D program, aimed primarily at improving the active medium homogeneity.

\paragraph{NEXT} for Neutrino Experiment with a Xenon TPC is searching for the $\zeronu$ decay of $^{136}$Xe isotope at the Canfranc underground laboratory in Spain~\cite{art:NEXT_2016}.
This technology uses high-pressure gaseous Xenon at $15$~bar with using electroluminescence to amplify the signal (HPXe).
The gas medium allows to obtain longer particle tracks than with liquid Xenon and thus confers the ability to reconstruct the trajectory of the two emitted electrons, contributing to the suppression of backgrounds.
The NEXT-$100$ project, which deploys $100$~kg of enriched Xenon, aims to demonstrate the feasibility of such an experiment and its usefulness for the $\zeronu$ searches.


\paragraph{PandaX-III} also searches for the $\zeronu$ of $^{136}$Xe with a high $10$~bar pressure gas TPC~\cite{art:PANDA_2016}.
It is installed at the China Jin Ping underground Laboratory (CJPL) and contains $200$~kg of $90$\% enriched $^{136}$Xe.
The previous PandaX-II detector is a dark matter direct detection experiment.

\subsection{Liquid scintillators}
\label{subsec:scintillators}

In this section are presented two large-scale detectors, first designed to measure the solar neutrino oscillations.
By adding $\beta\beta$ isotopes to their large detection volume, they now both aim at searching for the $\zeronu$ decay.
The main drawbacks of these detectors are the poor energy resolution as well as the absence of event topology reconstruction.
This is nevertheless compensated by the high exposure, as they both contain the highest quantities of $\beta\beta$ isotopes, allowing to reach high $\Tbeta$ limits.
We also review two new liquid scintillator technologies.

\paragraph{KamLAND-ZEN} for Kamioka Liquid Scintillator Antineutrino Detector - Zero Neutrino Double Beta Decay Search, is located in the underground neutrino detection facility in Japan.
It uses the original design of KamLAND detector that precisely measured $2$ cycles of neutrino oscillations.
This detector searches for the $\zeronu$ decay of the $^{136}$Xe isotope, by installing a mini-balloon at the centre of KamLAND (Fig.~\ref{fig:KamLAND}).
The chosen isotope, enriched at $91$\%, is dissolved in a liquid scintillator, and a purification method is well-established for both of them, allowing to reach low internal background levels.
The first phase, the KamLAND-Zen $400$ project, was already terminated and its latest limit for half life of $\zeronu$ is $\Tbeta>1.07\times 10^{26}$~years at $90$\% CL~\cite{art:KamLAND2016}.
This result confirmed the feasibility of such high-scale technology, and KamLAND-Zen $800$ has started taking data in January $2019$ with $745$~kg of $^{136}$Xe, planning a $\sim 5$~years data acquisition.

\paragraph{SNO+} is an experiment using the existing SNO detector located in SNOLAB ($6000$ m.w.e.) in Canada, by replacing the water volume with a liquid scintillator.
This offers the possibility to search for the $\zeronu$ decay by loading $800$~kg of $^{130}$Te isotope into $780$~tons of scintillating solution.
The huge quantity of isotope loaded into SNO+ gives a significant advantage over other $\zeronu$ experiments.
This technology aims at reaching a lower limit on the $\zeronu$ half-life of $9 \times 10^{25}$~years after $5$ years.


\paragraph{ZICOS} is a new experiment using a liquid scintillator loaded with enriched zirconium.
The goal is to use $865$~kg of $^{96}$Zr enriched at $50$\% to reach a sensitivity of $\sim 1\times 10^{27}$~years.
This sensitivity would be achieved by an efficient \Tl\ background reduction using the information of Cherenkov light.

\paragraph{CANDLES} is a project searching for $\zeronu$ with $^{48}$Ca installed at the Kamioka underground laboratory.
The chosen isotope has an advantage of the highest $\Qbb$ of $4.27$~MeV.
The $96$ CaF2 scintillator detectors, for a total mass of $305$~kg, are immersed in a liquid scintillator.
Scintillation light from the CaF2 scintillators and from the liquid scintillator are measured by $62$ photomultiplier tubes (see Fig.~\ref{fig:CANDLES}).

\subsection{Tracking calorimeters}
\label{subsec:trackocalo}
Tracking calorimeters technology, instead of using a \emph{source-as-detector}, employ a passive source shaped as thin source foils of enriched $\beta\beta$ emitters.
Sources are placed at the detector centre, surrounded by two trackers allowing for particle identification (between electrons, positrons, $\gamma$ and $\alpha$ particles) and vertex reconstruction to improve the background rejection.
The whole is sandwiched between calorimeters enabling individual particle energy reconstruction.
This passive source tracking calorimeter technology provides topological information on angular emissions of the two electrons from $\beta\beta$ decay, making possible to distinguish between underlying mechanisms for $\zeronu$ decay in case of a discovery.

\paragraph{NEMO} for Neutrino Ettore Majorana Observatory was installed in LSM and has taken data from $2003$ to $2011$ with $7$ different $\beta\beta$ isotopes.
This detector has set limits on the $\zeronu$ half-life of these $7$ isotopes between $0.9\times 10^{19}$ and $1.1\times 10^{24}$~years.

\paragraph{SuperNEMO} experiment is a next-generation of detector, inheriting the lineage of the NEMO experiments.
It aims at searching for the $\zeronu$ decay of several isotopes as \Se, \Nd\ and $^{96}$Zr, with about $100$~kg of enriched material.
The detector will be composed of $20$ modules of $\sim 5$~kg of source each.
Giving its low isotope mass, SuperNEMO might not be the first experiment to observe the searched decay, but would identify the underlying mechanism responsible for this decay, thanks to its tracking capabilities.
The first module, aiming at demonstrate the scalability of such a technology, is on the commissioning phase, with $6.23$~kg of enriched \Se.

\subsection{Summary}

All experiments presented above aim at searching for the $\zeronu$ decay with specific features.
Various approaches have been reviewed in this section, and a non-exhaustive list of experiment has been given.
The results of the current generation of detectors will make it possible to determine which technologies are the best suited for the search for $\zeronu$ decay.

\section{Conclusion}

This chapter presented the questions that are still open around the physics of the neutrino.
This particle, discovered relatively late in the history of physics, could allow us to explore physics beyond the Standard Model, and to get closer to a more global theory of physics.
Notably, the observation of the $\zeronu$ decay would prove that the neutrino is a Majorana particle, while demonstrating that the lepton number is not a symmetry of physics.
Beyond the physics of the neutrino, such an observation would have great implications in many fields of physics, and this is why a multitude of experiments are looking for this disintegration.
The SuperNEMO detector, on which I worked during my PhD, is one such experiment.
