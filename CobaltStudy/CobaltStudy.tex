\chapter{Characterisation of the calorimeter time resolution}
\label{ch:Cobalt_study}

The precise knowledge of the different particle interaction times in the optical modules of the SuperNEMO calorimeter is important to better understand and reject the background.
For example, the study of electron time-of-flight allows us to distinguish internal events (occurring within the source foils) from external events (radioactive decays occurring outside the source foils, for example in the PMs or in the iron shielding).

During the commissioning phase, a lot of work, presented in the previous chapter, was achieved to calibrate the detector.
Following on from this task and completing it, a part of my PhD was allocated to determine the time resolution of the SuperNEMO calorimeter, and to provide tools to the collaboration to purchase this analysis.

In this chapter a study conducted in order to characterise the time response of the SuperNEMO optical modules with a \Co\ source is presented.
Some detector adjustments were still ongoing at the time of the acquisition and could influence the results discussed.
However, all the work presented here is necessary in the framework of the first calorimeter calibration.
Moreover, I provide all the analysis tools for the collaboration, with a view to doing a possible update, once the whole demonstrator calibration will be achieved.

%% \label{sec:Co_analysis}
%% This section is dedicated to detail the time resolution study performed using a \Co\ source, exploiting the time characteristic of two photons emitted during the radioactive disintegration process of this nucleus.
%% A great proportion of the whole SuperNEMO demonstrator was successfully characterised using this radioactive source.

\section{Time response of optical modules}
\label{subsec:OMtimeResponse}

In order to characterise the energy and time-of-flight of incoming particles (photons, electrons), each calorimeter block of SuperNEMO is composed of a scintillator and a photomultiplier.
As detailed in Chapter~\ref{ch:detector}, the purpose of the scintillator material is to transfer the kinetic energy of incoming particles through the production of the so-called optical photons.
Those reaching the photomultiplier photocathode are then converted into electrons, with an efficiency called quantum efficiency.
After amplification, electrons are collected by the anode which delivers an electric signal whose charge is proportional to the initial amount of incident photoelectrons.
This signal is then transmitted, via the PM voltage divider, to the electronic readout, where the signal is sampled.
The particle energy, as well as the time-of-flight, can be extracted from the signal waveform analysis.
Each step of the particle detection process, from the incident particle interaction inside the scintillator, to the signal sampling at the electronic readout, can have an impact on the precise time measurement of the charged particle.
In Chapters~\ref{ch:detector} and \ref{ch:timediff} we introduced the so-called calorimeter time resolution $\sigma_t$, which encapsulates the global uncertainty on the time-of-flight measurement of particles into the calorimeter (Eq.~\eqref{eq:sigma_t}).
The squared time-resolution can therefore be expressed as the sum of two contributions:
the scintillator resolution $\sigma_{t, \textrm{sc}}^{2}$, and the PM resolution $\sigma_{t, \textrm{PM}}^{2}$,
\begin{equation}
  \sigma_{t}^{2}=\sigma_{t,\text{sc}}^{2}+\sigma_{t,\text{PM}}^{2}\,.
  \label{eq:Co_sigma_t}
\end{equation}
In the following, we detail in depth the physical origins of these terms.

\subsection{Scintillator time dispersion}
The scintillator temporal dispersion $\sigma_{t,\text{sc}}$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:Co_sigma_t} receives contributions mainly from two important characteristics of the scintillator operating principle.

\subsubsection*{Interaction point}

The incoming particle's interaction point location inside the scintillator block highly contributes to the scintillator temporal uncertainty, and depends on the incident particle type.
In fact, this effect will not have the same impact on time dispersion, depending on whether the incident particle is a photon or an electron.
In Fig~\ref{fig:photon_scintilator} are schemed the interactions of a photon and that of an electron for the specific case of a SuperNEMO plastic scintillators.
In Sec.~\ref{sec:scintillator_interactions}, we exposed the different interaction types of photons and electrons.
We have also explained the origin of the differences that exist in terms of interaction depth between these two types of particles.
To remain consistent with these conclusions, we represent the electron as interacting in the first millimetres, while the photon stops deep inside the scintillator.
When a particle (photon or electron) interacts in the scintillating material, the absorbed energy leads to the isotropic emission of scintillation photons:
they propagate inside the scintillator, in all directions from the interaction point, at the speed of $c/n_{sc}$, with $n_{sc}$ the optical index of polystyrene, and $c$ the light speed in vacuum.
Depending on their initial direction, some of those photons propagate straight to the PM (we name them the \emph{direct} photons), while others are at least reflected once on the scintillator surface, before reaching the PM glass.
This mechanism leads to time delays between direct and reflected photons.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=8cm]{commissioning/fig_commissioning/Co_multi_reflection.pdf}
  \caption{A scheme of interaction of particles in a scintillator.
    The photon case is displayed on the left in pink dotted line, and the electron case is on the right in dark blue dotted line.
    Both particles enter in the scintillator through the front face.
    Examples of interaction points inside the scintillator are represented by the black dots.
    The photons of scintillation emitted isotropically after the interaction are materialised by the bright green dotted lines.
    Due to different interaction probabilities in matter, the two particles interact at different depths inside the scintillator.
    The photon can interact deeply inside the volume, while the electron has a high probability to stop within the first few millimetres.
    \label{fig:photon_scintilator}}
\end{figure}

In order to illustrate, and give an order of magnitude of this delay, let us consider an example where an incoming electromagnetic particle enters a scintillator from the front face, and interacts right in the centre of the scintillator volume.
After the scintillation emission process, a direct photon will reach the PM glass surface at time
\begin{equation}
  t_{s} = \frac{L}{2c/n_{sc}}\,,
\end{equation}
$L$ being the scintillator width.
Now, let us consider another photon, that we name \emph{backward reflected}, emitted in the opposite direction.
It will propagate, reflect on the front scintillator surface, and finally reach the PM at
\begin{equation}
  t_{r} = \frac{3L}{2c/n_{sc}}\,.
\end{equation}
This reflected photon is therefore delayed compared to the direct photon, with a time-shift of
\begin{equation}
  \Delta t^{r,s} = t_{r} - t_{s} = \frac{L}{c/n_{sc}}\,.
\end{equation}
In the case of a SuperNEMO scintillator, the length $L$ has been designed to $25$ cm, and the optical index is the one of polystyrene with $n_{sc}=1.5$.
Finally, for an incoming particle interacting at the centre of a SuperNEMO scintillator volume, a backward reflected scintillation photon will reach the PM glass $1.25$ ns later than a direct photon.
And this delay is even more important as the incident particle interacts deep inside the scintillator.

In view of the conclusions given in Sec.~\ref{sec:scintillator_interactions}, we know that photons have a higher probability of interacting far into the scintillator block, compared with electrons.
Therefore, this time-shift effect is all the more important for incoming photons, while it is quite negligible for incoming electrons, for which reflected photoelectrons reach the PM glass almost as the same time as the direct ones.

This mechanism increases the signal collection rising time at the PM anode, and boosts the scintillator time dispersion $\sigma_{t,\text{sc}}$, with $\sigma_{t,\text{sc}}^{\gamma}>\sigma_{t,\text{sc}}^{\text{e}^{-}}$.
This geometrical uncertainty does not contribute to $\sigma_{t}$ and contributes to the time uncertainty brought by the track length.

\subsubsection*{Scintillating light emission}
When a particle interacts in a SuperNEMO scintillator, two successive mechanisms of light absorption/re-emission take place.
Firstly, the excitation of scintillator molecules leads to the creation of fluorescence photons.
Afterwards, those optical photons are absorbed, then re-emitted by the POPOP agent, at higher wavelengths.
The characteristic times of these two processes contribute to increase the scintillator time dispersion $\sigma_{t,\text{sc}}$.
%% These two processes follow the same temporal distribution
%% \begin{equation}
%%   \mathcal{N}_{\text{photons}} = A\times e^{-t/\tau}\,,
%%   \label{eq:fluorescence_photons_time}
%% \end{equation}
%% with $\mathcal{N}_{\text{photons}}$ the number of generated photons at time $t$, $A$ a normalisation constant and $\tau$ the fluorescence characteristic time of the considered process.

\subsection{Photomultiplier time dispersion}

A photomultiplier is a photodetector: after the light is collected and converted at the photocathode, the photoelectrons are multiplied.
The transit time for the photoelectrons emitted at the photocathode to reach the anode after being multiplied is not constant for every photoelectron, due to a varying path for electrons emitted by the different dynodes.
This results in a timing dispersion.
This fluctuation is called transit time spread (TTS).
It leads to an uncertainty on the time measurement and so has an influence on the photomultiplier time dispersion $\sigma_{t,\text{PM}}$.

As discussed in Chapter~\ref{ch:timediff}, the time uncertainty brought by the scintillator light emission process and the photomultiplier was characterised for few optical modules before the calorimeter assembly.
It is possible that the optical modules time resolutions may have changed during the phases following their measurement, so they must be measured again.
To do so, data acquisitions were taken with the calorimeter, behind which a \Co\ calibration source was set, allowing to detect in coincidence two emitted $\gamma$'s.


\section{Description of \Co\ nucleus}
\label{subsec:CoSource}
The \Co\ is a man-made isotope, with a $5.27$ years half-life, of which we provide the main interesting properties in the simplified decay scheme of Fig.~\ref{fig:Co_decay_scheme}.
This unstable nucleus spontaneously decays, through the $\beta^{-}$ process, into an excited state of Nickel $60$.
To reach the ground state of the Nickel $60$, the nucleus goes through two successive energy levels, emitting in $99.83$\% of the cases two photons of $1.17$ MeV and $1.33$ MeV, respectively.
The life-time of the second energy level is under the picosecond, thus very short with respect to the expected timing precision of the calorimeter.
Therefore, the two photons are considered as emitted in coincidence.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=9cm]{commissioning/fig_commissioning/Co_decay_scheme.pdf}
  \caption{A simplified decay scheme for \Co~\cite{web:nucleide}.
    The \Co\ decays, through $\beta^{-}$, predominantly to the $2.50$ MeV state.
    Then, two successive $\gamma$'s (whose energy levels are represented in green) are emitted in $99.83$\% of the cases.
    The two photons have an energy of $1.17$ MeV and $1.33$ MeV, respectively.
    As the life-time of the $1.33$ MeV energy level is short ($<1$ ps) with respect to the timing precision of the calorimeter, the two photons can be considered as emitted in coincidence.
    We use this property to calibrate in time the demonstrator optical modules.
    \label{fig:Co_decay_scheme}}
\end{figure}

We aim to detected these two photons and look for coincidences between pairs of optical modules to determine their time resolutions.


\section{Experimental design}
\label{subsec:Co_setup}


The idea to use a \Co\ source to characterise the time response of the calorimeter part of SuperNEMO had never been tested on the full calorimeter before the current analysis.
Therefore, all the experimental design had to be implemented.


\subsection{Setting up the experimental design}


The initial activity of the \Co\ source we used for this experimental set-up was $447.4$ kBq in February $2014$.
Given the half-life of this isotope, it was reduced to $232$ kBq at the time of the data-taking.
In order to determine the best design, and later to monitor and compare the results obtained in the framework of this analysis, I performed simulations of \Co\ disintegrations for the demonstrator configuration.
The characteristics of those simulations are detailed later in this section.

As described in Chapter~\ref{ch:detector}, the SuperNEMO calorimeter is composed of two main walls (called \emph{French} and \emph{Italian} sides), as well as the so-called X-Walls (on the detector sides) and $\gamma$-Vetos (on top and below the detector).
At the time of the data-taking, X-Walls and $\gamma$-Vetos were not yet operational, hence the current analysis only applies on the French and Italian main calorimeter walls.
As the demonstrator was closed at this time, it was impossible to set the \Co\ source inside the detector, at the source foils level.
Hence, the calibration source was placed behind the calorimeter, as displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:Co_exp_design}, where sketches of side and back views of the calorimeter are drawn.
In order for all PMs to detect $\gamma$'s from \Co\ decays, several bunches of data acquisitions were taken:
the source was placed at $9$ different positions on each of the $2$ main calorimeter walls, approximately one meter behind.
Therefore, in total, $19$ data acquisitions have been taken, of which:
\begin{itemize}
\item $18$ with the \Co\ source set behind the wall. The $9$ different positions for one wall are represented in Fig.~\ref{subfig:Co_setup_wall}.
\item $1$ acquisition have been taken without the \Co\ source, with the Italian main wall, to characterise the background detected with the current calorimeter settings.
\end{itemize}
Each data acquisition lasted about $25$ minutes, for a total of $10$ hours of on-site activities, taking into account the time needed to move the \Co\ source from spot to spot.
\begin{figure}[h]

    Each grey box represents an optical module.
    \label{fig:Co_exp_design}
  }
\end{figure}

Currently, the demonstrator is not protected from the laboratory lights by the anti-radon tent.
As those would damage the SuperNEMO photomultipliers under tension, two removable black curtains are deployed on top of the detector (that do not interfere with data collection), and acquisitions are taken in dark laboratory.
With this way of doing, all data acquisitions can be performed, while eventual necessary repairs remain possible during the detector commissioning.

Taking acquisitions in the dark is a big constraint.
Moreover, the \Co\ source, initially used for teaching purposes, was loan by IPN laboratory (Orsay), for only two weeks, mainly because of legal constraints.
Therefore, to not disturb LSM on-site activities by plunging the whole laboratory into darkness, and to make the loan time profitable, a SuperNEMO team and I performed night shifts to take data.
The acquisition took place during two weeks, at the summer break $2019$.

\subsection{Simulations and analysis pipelines}


As for the data acquisition, the simulated source has been placed behind the calorimeter walls.
Hopefully, there was no need to simulate all the $18$ positions.
In fact, at this time, the detector implemented in simulations is symmetrical in terms of detection performances.
Therefore, simulations of \Co\ events behind the two main walls are equivalent, and we only need to simulate events from $4$ locations (positions $1$, $2$, $4$ and $5$, according to the Fig.~\ref{subfig:Co_setup_wall} numbering system), other being obtained by symmetry operations.
Four bunches, for a total of $10^{9}$ \Co\ events, were simulated with the official Falaise pipeline and stored at the IN$2$P$3$ computing centre platform, making them available to the collaboration.

As the objective is to determine the optical modules time resolution, $\sigma_{t}$, due to the scintillator light emission process and to the photomultiplier, all simulations were performed with an ideal calorimeter, setting up ${\sigma_{t}=0}$~ps.
In that case, the only remaining contribution of optical modules to the time resolution is geometrical and comes from the interaction point uncertainty inside the scintillator.
The idea behind that is to compare simulated and real data in order to bring out the contribution of $\sigma_{t}$ to the total calorimeter time uncertainty.

%% A visualisation, provided by the Falaise Software, of a simulated \Co\ event behind the Italian calorimeter main wall, is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Co_visu}.
%% \begin{figure}[h]
%%   \centering
%%   \includegraphics[width=6cm]{commissioning/fig_commissioning/Co_visu.pdf}
%%   \caption{Visualisation of a simulated \Co\ event.
%%     \label{fig:Co_visu}}
%% \end{figure}

%% \paragraph{Background events simulations:}
%% As already discussed in Chapter~\ref{ch:sensitivity}, currently the collaboration does not supply a complete set of external background simulations for the demonstrator design.
%% This will be implemented as soon as the final demonstrator performances has been determined.
%% Thus, we did not have at our disposal background events simulations for this analysis.

The entire experimental set-up was designed and carried out by me and a group of physicists from LAL, Orsay and LPC, Caen.
I developed a complete set of ROOT codes for data processing and analysis, available on the GitHub platform~\cite{myGit}.
As the tracker is not yet operational for data collection at Modane, we are only interested in the part of the simulations with the calorimeter.
Several criteria described in the following section were used to select the \Co\ events of interest.
A single off-line analysis pipeline has been developed to handle the different output data models of the simulations and real data, in order to ensure the consistency of the analysis.

\section{Signal events selection}
\label{subsec:Co_datacut}

We aim to use the two $\gamma$'s of $1.17$ MeV and $1.33$ MeV from \Co\ $\beta^{-}$ decay, to characterise the time resolutions of individual optical modules.
Thus, the signal we are looking for is two particles detected in coincidence in distinct optical modules.
In order to maximise the signal to background ratio, some selections have been applied on data.
\begin{itemize}
\item Trigger criteria:\\ in the two calorimeter hits channel, the trigger condition is defined so as one of the two hit has to trigger the low energy (or amplitude) threshold, of $50$~keV for the data acquisition.
  As we look for two calorimeter hits, we set an additional off-line selection events whose two hits passed both the high amplitude threshold, corresponding to approximately $150$ keV.
\item Coincidence time criterion:\\ we define the coincidence time-window by events occurring in a $62.5$ ns-long time interval.
  This allows to avoid accidental coincidence events (interactions of two gammas, produced by different sources, in two optical modules), while keeping events where two $\gamma$ particles interact at both ends of the wall.
  This time-window was set for the data-taking and can be improved for eventual future acquisitions.
\item Individual energy selection:\\ in Fig.~\ref{fig:Co_energy_cut} is displayed the highest energy deposit as a function of the lowest energy deposit, for simulations with the \Co\ source in position $5$.
  The high energy threshold is represented by two black dotted lines.
  The topology of interest is observable with two hits around $1$~MeV.
  Also, events where two successive Compton interactions of a single photon from \Co\ occur in two different optical modules are characterised by a high energy hit ($\sim 0.8$ MeV), and a low energy hit ($\sim 0.2$ MeV).
  This topology constitutes a background for this analysis because the time difference between the hits has a different distribution.
  In order to reject them, given the energies of the two interesting \Co\ photons, we only select individual calorimeter hit energies greater than $0.7$ MeV.
  This individual energy selection is pictured by two black dashed lines.
  It naturally highly depends on the calorimeter energy calibration.
  %% If this energy selection is aims to reject \Co\ $\gamma$ particles, but not for background such as \Tl.
  \begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=14cm]{commissioning/fig_commissioning/Co_energy_cut.pdf}
    \caption{Maximal energy with minimal energy, for simulated \Co\ events, with source in position $5$ (see Fig.~\ref{subfig:Co_setup_wall}).
      High threshold is represented in black dotted line.
      Dashed lines materialise the individual energy selections.
      \label{fig:Co_energy_cut}}
  \end{figure}
\item Geometrical selection:
  with a detector well calibrated in energy, the previous selection is sufficient to prevent double Compton interactions to be selected.
  But, at the time of the data-taking, the detector was not fully calibrated.
  The energy of some reconstructed particle hits then might be badly estimated and some background events could pass this energy selection.
  As such interactions occur predominantly in two close scintillators, we reject topologies where two neighbouring optical modules detect signal in the coincidence window.
  The detector energy calibration is discussed in Sec.~\ref{subsec:Co_energy_calib}.
\end{itemize}
These four selections are intended to improve the signal to background ratio.
The coincidence time selection is only applied to real data, while others are applied both to simulations and real data.
Indeed, what we call an \emph{event} does not have the same meaning depending on whether we are talking about simulation or real data.
We simulate a given amount of disintegrations at given location(s) of the detector, so the definition of a Monte Carlo event is straightforward, and concepts such as the pile up make no sense.
For real data acquisitions, a set of criteria have to be established in order to define what an event is, as the time coincidence window for example.

We remind the signification of the selection efficiency $\epsilon$ which is
\begin{equation}
  \epsilon = \frac{\text{Number of selected events}}{\text{Number of generated events}}\,.
\end{equation}
Selection efficiencies for cut-offs applied successively are presented in table~\ref{tab:Co_cut_eff}.
Significant differences are observed between simulations are real data, mainly due to the energy calibration.
Indeed, at the time of the data taking, the gain equalisation and energy calibration were preliminary and had to be improved.
Therefore, this statement directly affects the reconstructed energies of calorimeter hits.
We address this question in Sec.~\ref{subsec:Co_energy_calib}.

\section{Energy calibration}
\label{subsec:Co_energy_calib}

The charge collected at each PM divider is correlated to an energy initially deposited inside the scintillator.
It is important to provide a robust calibration, allowing to provide a relation between these two observables, for any analysis to be valid.
At the time of the data acquisition with the \Co\ source, only an incomplete energy calibration was provided.
Indeed, as the calorimeter was at the beginning of the commissioning phase, several tests were performed, in particular manipulations that required changing the values of the high voltages.
The equalisation of gains was therefore not yet implemented, which had an impact on the resolution in terms of energy.
In this context, I developed a temporary energy calibration using the data taken with the \Co\ source.

In Fig.~\ref{subfig:Co_calib_charge} is displayed charge spectra for two optical modules located in front of the \Co\ calibration source.
In order to have a sufficient statistics, only trigger selection have been applied on data, allowing to select events for which exactly two optical modules triggered (at least one must have triggered the high amplitude threshold).
The first peak is mainly populated by double Compton interactions inside the scintillator, and the second by simple Compton interaction of the two \Co\ $\gamma$'s of interest.
For this energy calibration, the second peak is used as the particular point of the distribution.
An automatic research of the two peaks is performed and, if exactly two are detected, the second one is fitted with a Gaussian function.
This point has been chosen because it is less statistics-dependent than the end point of the distribution.
In the figure, an example of an optical module with an appropriate gain is given, and the fit is well-performed.
An example of an optical module with a too low gain (because it was under a too low high voltage) is also displayed, and shows only one peak.
These kind of distributions were thus not fitted and no energy calibration was provided for them.
\begin{figure}[h]

  \caption{Data acquisition charge (a) and simulated energy (b) spectra.
    If two peaks are detected, the second one is fitted with a Gaussian.
    When the OM gain is too low, the lower energy peak, due to a double Compton interaction of a \Co\ gamma in two scintillator blocks, is less likely to be detected an the OM is not calibrated.
    \label{fig:Co_calib}}
\end{figure}

The same work is performed on simulated energy distributions for all optical modules.
The fits provide an average of the energy location point corresponding to the second peak, of $0.927\pm0.009$~MeV.
This work allowed to calibrate $172$ optical modules, in total, for the French main wall.
An energy spectrum of a successfully calibrated optical module is given in Fig.~\ref{fig:calib_energy_OM} after event selection has been applied.
We find the results obtained in the previous section concerning the difference in efficiency between simulations and real data.
As all optical modules are now equalised in gain, this result will be improved by the new data acquisitions planned for the end of October $2020$.
We also notice that the data spectrum extends at higher energies than simulations, corresponding to the \Tl\ background.

    \label{fig:calib_energy_OM}}
\end{figure}

Selection efficiencies for each cut-off, after the energy calibration, are given in Tab.~\ref{tab:Co_cut_eff_calib}.
We notice an improvement at the level of individual energy cut, where the selection efficiency is reduced compared with the previous case using the energy calibration provided by the collaboration.
\begin{table}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    & Simulations & Data \\
    \hline\hline
    High threshold & $35.7$\% & $94.0$\% \\
    Individual energy & $17.0$\% & $58.0$\% \\
    Geometrical & $16.5$\% & $51.9$\% \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Selection efficiencies for simulations and real data.
    Energy calibration with \Co\ data have been applied.
    \label{tab:Co_cut_eff_calib}}
\end{table}

This is a temporary calibration, only use in the framework of this analysis, and does not replace the more complete one accomplished for later data acquisitions.
An amelioration could be brought with a double fit of the two peaks.
Nevertheless, this improvement is not necessary since the gains were not yet aligned but it would be interesting to try this method again with the new \Co\ data.


\section{Background estimation}
\label{subsec:bkg_estimation}

The signal for this analysis is composed two $\gamma$'s of $1.17$ MeV and $1.33$ MeV, emitted after \Co\ disintegrations.
After application of the four selections, it is primordial to estimate and characterise the remaining background in the selected topology, detected by the calorimeter during the data acquisition.

\subsection{Types of background}

Mainly three different types of background can be harmful for this analysis, all pictured in Fig.~\ref{fig:Co_bkg}.
\begin{itemize}
\item Through a double Compton interaction, a single \Co\ $\gamma$ particle can deposit energy in two scintillator blocks (see Fig.~\ref{subfig:Co_bkg_2}).
As described in Sec.~\ref{subsec:Co_datacut}, the geometrical and individual energy selections have been set up to reject these background events.
\item Photons coming from the natural radioactive decay chains of $^{238}$U, $^{232}$Th and $^{40}$K isotopes.
Typically, the $2.615$ MeV-$\gamma$, from \Tl\ decay, can interact successively in two scintillators through Compton scatterings and produce high energy events (see Fig.~\ref{subfig:Co_bkg_1}).
These disintegration can occur in the source foils or in the detector's components (mainly PM glass).
\item At the time of the data acquisition, the calorimeter was in commissioning phase, and the iron shielding was not yet installed.
Therefore, the calorimeter was not properly protected from external particles, coming from outside the detector (radioactive isotope contamination of laboratory rock).
Accidental events where two decorrelated $\gamma$ particles, can be detected in two scintillator blocks (see Fig.~\ref{subfig:Co_bkg_3}).
The coincidence time window should avoid these accidental to be selected.
\end{itemize}
All these three topologies can mimic the \Co\ two-$\gamma$'s signal.

\end{figure}
In order to characterise the two last types of background (decorrelated from the \Co\ source), a background data acquisition, without the \Co\ calibration source, has been performed.
Unfortunately, be owing to optical modules gain issues, these data are not usable.
Therefore, we use the data acquisition taken with the \Co\ source set behind the wall to estimate this background.

\subsection{Background characterisation}

When the \Co\ source is set behind the wall, collected data may contain signal events coming from it as well as background events.
Let us assume these background events are dominated by radioactive decays and external $\gamma$'s, by considering the background coming from double Compton interactions of \Co\ $\gamma$'s have been efficiently removed by application of the individual energy cut.
We choose to model the \Co\ data as a linear combination of signal events $s$ and background events $b$
\begin{equation}
  \hat{d}=s+b\,,
  \label{eq:estimation_data}
\end{equation}
where $s$ and $b$ are thus considered as uncorrelated.
The question is how to extract informations about background, using the \Co\ data acquisitions?
We remind the \Co\ source was placed at different positions behind the calorimeter wall.
We aim to take advantage of those different configurations to reach our goal.
In the following, we make use of the positions $2$ and $8$ for the \Co\ source.

Therefore, depending on whether the source is in one of the two positions, some optical modules are \emph{close} to it, others are \emph{far}.
More precisely, we consider as \emph{close}, the optical modules that are separated from the source by less than 10 optical modules (i.e. less than half the wall-length), the others being \emph{far} from it\footnote{For example, an optical module located on the left (right) of the calorimeter wall, is considered as far from (close to) the source, if the source is in position $8$.}.
Considering that, we distinguish two categories of data, $\hat{d}^{\,\text{close}}$ and $\hat{d}^{\,\text{far}}$, defined as the estimations of data events detected by an optical module when the source is close to, or far from it, respectively.
Then, we precise our data model with
\begin{equation}
  \hat{d}^{\,\text{close}} = b + s^{\,\text{close}}\,,
  \label{eq:estimation_data_close}
\end{equation}
where $s^{\,\text{close}}$ is naturally the number of signal \Co\ events detected by a given optical module for which the distance from the source, $D_{\,\text{source}}$, is lower than $10$.
In the same way, considering $s^{\,\text{far}}$ as signal events detected by an optical module from which the source is far, we have
\begin{equation}
  \hat{d}^{\,\text{far}} = b + s^{\,\text{far}}\,.
  \label{eq:estimation_data_far}
\end{equation}
Estimations of $s^{\,\text{close}}$ and $s^{\,\text{far}}$ (respectively noted $\tilde{s}^{\,\text{close}}$ and $\tilde{s}^{\,\text{far}}$) are provided using simulations of \Co\ events in positions $2$ or $8$.
Indeed, as we consider the double Compton interaction background as negligible, the amount of signal events received for optical modules far or close from the source can be established with \Co\ simulations.
Then, the coefficient $\alpha$ defined as
\begin{equation}
  \alpha = \tilde{s}^{\,\text{far}}/\tilde{s}^{\,\text{close}}\,.
\end{equation}
It depends on the distance $D_{\,\text{source}}$ and is found to be $0.05 \% < \alpha < 5 \%$, meaning that the number of simulated signal events detected by optical modules distant from the source is greatly lower than for close optical modules, for a given source position.

In order to provide a non-biased estimation of $b$ given the data model in Eq.~\eqref{eq:estimation_data_far}, we would remove $\tilde{s}^{\,\text{far}}$, estimated through simulations, from $\hat{d}^{\,\text{far}}$, which can be estimated with \Co\ data acquisition.
%%on voudrait avoir b=dfar, mais c'est biaisé pcq il reste signal. On pourrait enlever sfar, mais
%%c'est la merde de faire ça avec les simus
To do so, we display in Fig.~\ref{fig:Co_data_bkg} the number of calorimeter hits, after event selection, counted by each optical module, as a function of the distance to the \Co\ source.
The $10$ optical modules limit is materialised by a vertical dashed line.
Calorimeter hits that occurred in coincidence above and below this limit are displayed both for simulated and real data.
Therefore, events where the two hits occur in two optical modules, each located in one half of the calorimeter, are not represented.
This explains the observable gap at the $10$ optical modules limit level.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1.1\textwidth]{commissioning/fig_commissioning/Co_data_bkg.eps}
  \caption{Number of events for pairs of OMs close and far from the source, for real data (orange) and simulated data (blue), as a function of the distance to the source (in units of number of OM).
    The vertical dashed line materialises the distance limit of $10$ OMs from the source.
    \label{fig:Co_data_bkg}}
\end{figure}

We first focus on simulation results.
Calorimeter hits for which $D_{\,\text{source}}<10$ represent the estimation of the amount of signal events detected close to the source, $\tilde{s}^{\,\text{close}}$.
Similarly, hits for which $D_{\,\text{source}}>10$ embed for $\tilde{s}^{\,\text{far}}$, the amount of signal events remaining for optical modules far from the calibration source site.
As expected, the number of signal \Co\ events decreases with the distance to the source.
Moreover, this decrease is linear, showing the same slope beyond and above the $10$ optical modules limit.

Regarding real data acquisition, calorimeter hits for which $D_{\,\text{source}}<10$ materialise the number of data events estimation $\hat{d}^{\,\text{close}}$.
Apart from slight differences due to the detector efficiency, these data events follow the same linear evolution as signal events with the distance to the source.
This leads us to conclude that optical modules close to the source are dominated by \Co\ signal events.
Similarly, $D_{\,\text{source}}>10$ events stand for $\hat{d}^{\,\text{far}}$.
We observe that $\tilde{s}^{\,\text{far}}/\hat{d}^{\,\text{far}} \ll 1$, which is compatible with the $\alpha$ coefficient values, being $5\%$ in the worse case, explaining the few amount of $\tilde{s}^{\,\text{far}}$ events remaining for optical modules far from the source.
Moreover, we find that the amount of $\hat{d}^{\,\text{far}}$ events is globally stable with the distance to the source, which confirms the assumption made that, at such distances from the source, radioactive contaminant decays and external $\gamma$'s interactions dominate the background contribution and are decorrelated from the \Co\ source.
%% donc bkg qui ne vient pas de la source
Therefore, for a $25$ minutes run, each optical module detects around $10^{2}$ external background events.
%% différence data/simus dans close : gain equalization ptetre pas dégueu sinon on verrait une diff
%% à ce niveau là. gain equalisation of optical modules, discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:comm_energy_calibration}, could impact greatly the .

To sum up these results, calorimeter hits for optical modules close to the \Co\ calibration source are, for the most part, signal events.
Besides, hits occurring far from the source are predominantly background events.
As we moved the source in different positions, we have access to the estimation of background rate $\hat{b}$ for each optical module (when the source is far), and to the estimation of $\hat{s}$ (when the source is close).
Therefore, we can compute the signal to background ratio, as a function of the distance to the \Co\ source, displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:Co_ratioSB}.
The number of signal events in each optical module depends on the distance to the source, which is not the case for the number of background events, explaining the decreasing of $S/B$ with $D_{\,\text{source}}$.
For this reason, the distribution stabilises at high $D_{source}$ ($\sim8$ OM units) as these optical modules are more sensitive to the flat background contribution than those right in front of the source.

%% on mesure alpha et il est petit donc on peut négliger sfar dans la modélisation

To summarise, in this subsection, we gave informations on background events for the whole French wall, using data taken with the \Co\ source set at different positions.
We confirmed our assumption that the more one optical block is far from the source, the less it detects $\gamma$ particles emitted after \Co\ disintegrations, then the more the signal to background ratio decreases.

\section{Determination of the optical modules timing resolution}


The final goal of this analysis is to determine $\sigma_{t}$, the time resolution of optical modules.
As displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:Co_decay_scheme}, given the time resolution of SuperNEMO, the two photons emitted from \Co\ can be considered as emitted in coincidence.
The selections described in Sec.~\ref{subsec:Co_datacut} aim to maximise the signal to background ratio, the signal being the detection of two $\gamma$'s interacting in two different optical modules.


\subsection{Time difference distributions}

The speed of the two $\gamma$’s travelling in the air is considered as equal to that in vacuum, $c$, and reach the two optical modules at two different times $t^{\gamma}_{i}$.
These time-of-flights are defined from the sampling of the collected charge, using the CFD method described in Chapter~\ref{ch:commissioning}.
These topologies are likely to happen for all combinations of pairs of optical modules.
Therefore, for each pair of calorimeter optical module, $A$ and $B$, we can construct a time difference distribution between two hits, defined as $\Delta t^{\text{pair}} = t^{\gamma}_{A} - t^{\gamma}_{B}$.
The two time-of-flights $t^{\gamma}_{A}$ and $t^{\gamma}_{B}$ are corrected from the time offset determined in the precedent Chapter~\ref{ch:commissioning}, due to the signal travelling inside coaxial cables and to the FEBs time offsets.
For a given pair, one of the two optical modules is chosen as reference, here $A$.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:Co_deltat} is presented an example of a $\Delta t^{\text{pair}}$ distribution, for a given pair of optical modules, both for the simulated and real data, with the \Co\ source set in position $5$.
%% on ne regarde des coincidences que pour paires OM sur un même mur
The two distributions present different behaviours in terms of means and standard deviations.
This can be explained by two distinct reasons.
Firstly, as exposed in Sec.~\ref{subsec:OMtimeResponse} the simulation are processed with perfect optical modules in terms of time-of-flight measurement.
It is thus expected that the standard deviation is higher for real data than for simulations.
Even though the case presented is just an example for a given pair of optical modules, this is a general result for all pairs.
Secondly, we notice the mean of the real data distribution is shifted towards negative values.
This is induced by a systematic time delay of particle time-of-flight value for real data.
This result is observed for all pairs of optical modules.
As the time-of-flights are corrected from the coaxial cables and FEBs time offsets, this difference could be caused by a difference between simulated and real location of the \Co\ source.
Moreover, the shift of the mean could also be the consequence of an incorrect energy calibration, that can lead to the selection of background events such as double Compton interactions in two successive optical modules.
The average time-of-flight difference for such background events is different from that if signal events, and therefore their accidental selection could be the cause of the observed discrepancy.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=15cm]{commissioning/fig_commissioning/Co_deltat_distrib_ex.eps}
  \caption{$\Delta t^{\text{pair}}$ distributions for real data (green solid line) and simulated data (dark red solid line).
    Two Gaussian fits (dotted line) are displayed and fit parameters are given in the legend box.
    \label{fig:Co_deltat}}
\end{figure}

Such  $\Delta t^{\text{pair}}$ distributions are defined for each pair of optical modules detecting events in coincidence.
The least square method is used to fit the distributions, which minimises the difference between the measured value and the fitted value.
A mean and a standard deviation is then defined for each pair of optical module whose fitted data has $\chi^{2}/\text{dof}<4$.
Therefore, due to a lack of statistics, some distributions cannot be fitted properly, and are rejected by the algorithm.
At the end, each pair of optical module whose $\Delta t^{\text{pair}}$ distribution fit is selected is characterised by the mean and standard deviation of this fit.
The distribution standard deviation, noted $\Sigma_{t}$, is called \emph{coupled time uncertainty} and corresponds to the uncertainty on time measurement for this peculiar pair of optical module.
It was checked graphically that the $\Sigma_{t}$ distributions were Gaussian, so the variance of $\Sigma_{t}^{2}$ is noted
\begin{equation}
  \Var[\Sigma_{t}^{2}] = \frac{2\,\Sigma_{t}^{\,4}}{N-1}\,,
  \label{eq:var_sigma_pair}
\end{equation}
where $N$ is the number of events detected in coincidence for this pair of optical module.

\subsection{Coupled time uncertainties}

The data acquisition was taken with $254$ optical modules from French wall instead of $260$: at this time three optical modules were out of order, and three photomultipliers whose gain were too low were removed from the analysis.
Moreover, in the framework of this study, we intend to characterise timing resolution of $8$~inches optical modules only.
At the end $214$ optical modules were considered, representing more than ${2\times10^{4}}$ different pairs of optical modules.

%% In Fig.~\ref{fig:Co_corr_sigma} are presented the $\Sigma_{t}$ values, both for simulated and real data.
%% \begin{figure}[h]
%%   \centering
%%   \includegraphics[width=15cm]{\Co\Study/fig_CobaltStudy/Co_corr_sigma.eps}
%%   \caption{$\Sigma_{t}$ distribution for pairs of optical modules.
%%     \label{fig:Co_corr_sigma}}
%% \end{figure}
%% In the first place, we notice the mean $\Sigma_{t}$ value for simulations is lower than for real data.
%% As explained above, this difference is caused by the perfect calorimeter time resolution for simulations on one side, and by possible double Compton background events selected.
%% This second statement is also behind the larger value of the real data distribution's standard deviation.
%% In fact, for the simulated case, $\Delta{t}$ distributions, of which an example is given in Fig.~\ref{fig:Co_deltat}, have comparable $\Sigma_{t}$ values, for all pairs of optical modules.
%% This is not the case for the real data: the $\Sigma_{t}$ value for a given pair of optical module depends on the difference between the two coaxial cable lengths.
%% And this length difference is specific for each pair of optical module.

With this method, we succeed to provide $\Sigma_{t}$ values for $26$\% of pairs of optical blocks for real data, against $87$\% for simulations.
This difference is due to a lack of statistics for real data.
In Fig.\ref{fig:Co_sigma_distance} is displayed the number of characterised optical blocks, with the distance between the reference block and the \Co\ source, in OM units.
The further away an optical module is from the source, the less likely the fit successes.
Moreover, for a given distance from the source, the amount of characterised optical module is lower for the real data case than for the simulated one, explaining the lower amount of provided $\Sigma_{t}$ values for real data.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=15cm]{commissioning/fig_commissioning/Co_sigma_distance.eps}
  \caption{Number of characterised OM pairs, as a function of the distance between reference OM and source.
    \label{fig:Co_sigma_distance}}
\end{figure}


%% Indeed, the more an optical module is far from the source, the more and more background dominated, and the less the number of signal events topologies are selected.

%% As a $\Sigma_{t}$ value is provided for an optical module pair only if the fit of the corresponding $\Delta t^{\text{pair}}$ distribution passed the $\chi^{2}$ selection.
%% Therefore, the less statistics for a given optical module pair, the less probable a $\Sigma_{t}$ can be provided.

%% Therefore, the optical modules for which the fit successes are the ones around the source.
%% This assumption is not valid for simulations are we only have Cobalt events, and no background is
%% simulated.

We presented results on the uncertainty on time measurement for pairs of optical modules, $\Sigma_{t}$.
However, we are interested in providing the individual uncertainty of each optical modules, noted $\sigma_{t}$.
In the following, we present the algorithm we used to compute such value.



%%fig distrib mean and sigma

\subsection{Decoupling the $\Sigma_{t}$ uncertainties}

The $\Sigma_{t}$ values that have been determined are defined for pairs of optical modules and can therefore be expressed in terms of the individual time resolutions for each module.
In the framework of this study, we decide to consider trios of optical modules detecting coincidental events two by two.
Therefore, the pair uncertainty, $\Sigma_{t}$, can be considered as a linear combination of the individual optical module uncertainties, $\sigma_{t}$:
\begin{align}
  (\Sigma_{t}^{0,1})^{2} &= \frac{(\sigma_{t}^{0})^{2}}{\bar{E_{0}}} + \frac{(\sigma_{t}^{1})^{2}}{\bar{E_{1}}}\nonumber \\
  (\Sigma_{t}^{0,2})^{2} &= \frac{(\sigma_{t}^{0})^{2}}{\bar{E_{0}}} + \frac{(\sigma_{t}^{2})^{2}}{\bar{E_{2}}}\\
  (\Sigma_{t}^{1,2})^{2} &= \frac{(\sigma_{t}^{1})^{2}}{\bar{E_{1}}} + \frac{(\sigma_{t}^{2})^{2}}{\bar{E_{2}}} \nonumber\,,
  \label{eq:Co_sigma}
\end{align}
where $\bar{E}_{i}$ is the averaged energy measured by the optical module $i$, and $\sigma_{t}^{i}$ is its individual time uncertainty at $1$~MeV, so-called \emph{decorrelated time uncertainty}, the quantity we are seeking to determine.
Consequently, determining the three individual time resolutions is equivalent to solving this set of equations.
In the end, each decorrelated $\sigma_{t}$ is expressed as a linear combination of each $\Sigma_{t}$ of the optical modules trio.

In practice, this has to be done for all the optical modules for which the $\Delta {t}^{pair}$ distribution fit has provided a $\Sigma_{t}$ value.
With this in mind, the $\Sigma_{t}$ values are sorted by order of the number of coincidental events.
The work presented above is therefore applied to the first trio of this list.
Then the next trio is selected, etc...
In the end $\sigma_{t}$ is computed for each optical module.

The variance of a given $\sigma_{t}^{2}$ value, noted $\Var[\sigma_{t}^{2}]$, depends on the variance of the three $\Sigma_{t}$ defined in Eq.~\eqref{eq:var_sigma_pair}.
For instance, for a trio a optical modules we have
\begin{align}
  \Var[(\sigma_{t}^{0})^{2}\,] &= \Var \left[ \frac{1}{2\bar{E}_{0}} (\Sigma_{t}^{0,1}+\Sigma_{t}^{0,2}-\Sigma_{t}^{1,2})^{2} \right] \\
  &= \frac{1}{4\bar{E_{0}}^{2}}\, (\,\Var[(\Sigma_{t}^{0,1})^{2}\,]+\Var[(\Sigma_{t}^{0,2})^{2}\,]+\Var[(\Sigma_{t}^{1,2})^{2}\,]\,)\,,
\end{align}
where we assume the $\Sigma_{t}$ values are uncorrelated

In some cases, when an optical module has detected events in coincidence with more than two other optical modules, it can belongs to more than one trio.
Thus it is selected several times to participate in the de-correlation process of several different trios.
Each optical module can then have many decorrelated $\sigma_{t}$ values associated to it.
The mean of these values, $\bar{\sigma_{t}}$, then stands as the final time uncertainty for each optical module.
It is defined as the weighted average:
\begin{equation}
  \displaystyle
%%\bar{\sigma_{t}} = \sum_{i}^{N} \dfrac{(\sigma_{t}^{i})^{\,2}}{\Var[\sigma_{t}^{i}\,]} \left(\sum_{i}^{N} \Var[\sigma_{t}^{i}\,] \right)^{-1}\,,
 (\bar\sigma^i_{t})^2 = \sum_n^N  \dfrac{(\sigma^i_{t, n})^2}{\text{Var}[(\sigma^i_{t, n})^2]} \left(\sum_n^N \text{Var}[(\sigma^i_{t, n})^2]\right)^{-1}
\end{equation}
with $i$ the optical module index and $n$ The $n$th estimate made of $\sigma_{t}$.

The work presented in the current section can be applied to real and simulated data.
For each optical module, the simulated time uncertainty is subtracted in quadrature from the real time uncertainty, allowing to bring out the optical module time uncertainty defined in Eq.~\eqref{eq:Co_sigma_t}.
The distribution of $\bar{\sigma_{t}}$ for $8$~inches optical modules of the French wall is given in Fig.~\ref{fig:final_sigmas}.
On average, the time uncertainty stands at $570\pm130$~ps while few optical modules show large values, beyond $900$~ps.
Although these values are higher than expected, it should be borne in mind that they have been characterised under rather complicated conditions, where the detector was not yet fully calibrated.
In particular, the double Compton background, possibly poorly rejected due to imperfect energy calibration, can widen the $\Delta t^{pair}$ distributions and degrade the final results.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{CobaltStudy/fig_CobaltStudy/final_sigmas.pdf}
  \caption{Decorrelated time uncertainties $\bar{\sigma_{t}}$.
    \label{fig:final_sigmas}}
\end{figure}

However, it is important to keep in mind that we made strong assumptions about the properties of the system.
Thus, while the mean of this distribution should be well-estimated, the standard deviation may not be.
Indeed, we provided a very rough and naive estimate of the optical module time uncertainty $\sigma_{t}$, assuming Gaussian statistics, and uncorrelated estimate of the coupled time uncertainties $\Sigma_{t}$, as well as uncorrelated individual estimate of $\sigma_{t,n}$.
This is of course not the case.
In practice, we can do much better, by solving an over-determined system of equations that include all the $\Sigma_{t}$ and $\sigma_{t}$ at once.
Nevertheless, our naive estimate is sufficient for this preliminary analysis, and provides encouraging results, opening the door to a full calorimeter timing characterisation.

\section{Conclusion}


This study provided the first analysis of the resolution of the SuperNEMO demonstrator's calorimeter since its installation at Modane, where $26$\% of the demonstrator's optical modules could be characterised, representing more than $40$\% of the $8$~inches PMs.
It is an end to end work, from the experimental set up design, to the creation of the code and the analysis algorithm, through the acquisition of the calibration source and all the necessary administrative and security procedures, as well as the data acquisition at Modane.
An estimation of the background detected was also given and it was the opportunity to perform a quick energy calibration of the French main wall using the \Co\ source.
This preliminary study aims to be improved, and new data, taken in Modane at the end of October $2020$, will allow to purchase this work.
