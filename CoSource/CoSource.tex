\chapter{Characterisation of the calorimeter resolution}

Optical modules have been characterised before installation.
Most of the \Co\ $\beta$ desintegrations are followed by the emission of two $\gamma$s in coincidence (see Fig.~\ref{fig:Co_decay_scheme}).
The idea is to use this source to calibrate in time optical modules of SuperNEMO demonstrator by placing it behind the main calorimeter walls (the demonstrator being closed since ...) and using the two coincidence $\gamma$s.
Performing simulations of \Co\ desintegrations
