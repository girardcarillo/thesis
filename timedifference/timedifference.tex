\chapter{Improvement of the rejection of the internal Thallium-$208$ background}
\label{ch:timediff}

At the end of September $2018$, the $34$ enriched-Selenium source foils were installed on the demonstrator.
At this time, the internal \Tl\ and \Bi\ activities had already been measured by the BiPo detector, as well as the \Rn\ concentration inside the tracker chamber.
We described in the previous chapter the impact of these activities on the final detector sensitivity to the $\zeronu$ decay, and set up optimised topological selections adjusted to reject the Radon background.

However, the \Tl\ background also remains a troublesome source of background, even for $\beta\beta$ emitters with a high $\Qbb$.
Indeed, it contributes at high energies (up to $4$~MeV on the two electrons energy sum spectrum), because of the internal conversion of the $2.615$~MeV $\gamma$-ray.
In a context where the \Tl\ contamination is higher than expected, we focus in the current chapter on rejection techniques peculiarly adapted to reject internal \Tl\ events.
We study the influence of these techniques on $\zeronu$ events selection, and evaluate the impact on final detector sensitivity.

\section{Motivations}

In Chapters~\ref{ch:detector} and \ref{ch:sensitivity}, we presented the specifications set on the background activities, in order to reach an unprecedented limit on the $\zeronu$ process half-life of the \Se\ in $5$ years, with $100$~kg of the \Se\ isotope, with the final SuperNEMO detector.
Tab.~\ref{tab:real_target_act} summarises the target \Tl, \Bi\ and \Rn\ activities, and give a comparison with those measured by the collaboration.
We achieve the specified level of \Rn\ isotope inside with an air flow rate of $2$~m$^{3}$/h inside the wire chamber.
The BiPo detector was only capable of giving an upper limit on the \Bi\ level of $\mathcal{A}^{\text{Bi}}~<~290~\mu$Bq/kg, and future precise measurements with SuperNEMO demonstrator will constraint this value.
The BiPo measurements also showed that the \Tl\ contamination is about $30$ times greater than expected.
We give in Tab.~\ref{tab:Nbkg_wBi} the number of expected background events for the measured activities (taking the upper limit for \Bi\ contamination), for the demonstrator and final detector.

  \caption{Expected number of background events in optimised energy ranges for the SuperNEMO demonstrator ($17.5$~kg.y) and the final detector ($500$~kg.y exposure).
    The $\twonu$ half-life is taken as $\Ttwonu~=~9.39\times~10^{19}$~y, and the measured background activities are considered (with the upper limit for \Bi\ contamination).

    \label{tab:Nbkg_wBi}}
\end{table}
The \Tl\ level of activity has no implication for the demonstrator, as only one event is expected in the [$2.7$;$3.3$]~MeV energy region, after cut-off optimisations, with a $17.5$~kg.y exposure.
On the other hand, this background could be harmful for the final detector, with $21$ \Tl\ events expected in the region of interest [$2.6$,$2.95$]~MeV, for a $500$~kg.y exposure.
To overcome this effect, it is interesting to set a specific method designed to reject \Tl\ events.

In the next section, we describe the specific features of the Thallium internal background.
We develop a new technique of rejection, especially designed to identify internal \Tl\ events, based on electron Time-Of-Flight computation.

\section{The internal \Tl\ background}

Trace quantities of naturally-occurring radioactive isotopes inside the source foils can occasionally produce two-electron events, and thus can mimic $\beta\beta$-decay events.
The \Tl, a progeny of \Th, is one of the largest contribution to the internal background.
In fact, as explained in Chapter~\ref{ch:detector}, two electrons can be produced via $\beta$-decay followed by a M\o{}ller scattering, $\beta$-decay to an excited state with the subsequent internal conversion, or due to Compton scattering of the de-excitation photon (Fig.~\ref{fig:internal_contamination}).
%% The ultimate internal background for $\zeronu$ experiments is the $\twonu$ decay of the studied isotope.
%% When present in the source foils, \Tl\ and \Bi\ can mimic the $\zeronu$ signal by different processes (see Fig.~\ref{fig:internal_contamination}).

All the possible transitions for the \Tl\ isotope are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:Tl_scheme}.
\begin{figure}[!h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=13cm]{timedifference/fig_timediff/Tl_decay_scheme.pdf}
  \caption{A simplified disintegration scheme for the \Tl\ isotope.
    $81$~\% of the disintegration pass through the $294$~ps metastable energy level (orange).
    All disintegration go through the $2.615$~MeV energy level (green), where an orbital electron is ejected in $0.246$~\% of the cases through the internal conversion process.
  \label{fig:Tl_scheme}}
\end{figure}
This shows that \Tl\ always $\beta$-decays to an excited state of the \Pb\ daughter nuclei.
In more than $99$~\% of the decays, at least 2 $\gamma$'s are expected after the $\beta$ emission.
For $\zeronu$ detection, the most dangerous mode of $\beta\beta$-like events production comes from the internal conversion of the $2.615$ MeV-$\gamma$, resulting in two electrons emitted with a high energy sum.

\subsection{The internal conversion process}

An excited nucleus will practically constantly achieve a transition to a lower state by one of two processes: the emission of a $\gamma$-ray, or the ejection of one of the orbital electrons.
The latter, called \emph{internal conversion} (frequently abbreviated IC), is a second-order process, where one electron couples to one of the nucleon inside the excited nucleus.
Thus, in such a radioactive decay, the de-excitation energy of the nucleus is transferred \emph{directly} to a $j$-shell electron ($j=K,L,M...$).
A high-energy electron is therefore emitted from the atom, and carry off the energy
\begin{equation}
E_{IC} = E_{\gamma}-E_{j}\qquad (j=K,L,M...)\,,
\end{equation}
where $E_{j}$ is the binding energy of the electron in the $j$-shell, and $E_{\gamma}$ is the energy of the $\gamma$-ray.

This mechanism is possible because there is a non-zero probability of finding the electron within the nucleus, that is to say, the wave-function of the electron can penetrate the volume of the nucleus.
Consequently, due to their high nuclear penetration, electrons coming from the $1s$ state are more likely to be ejected (this transition is called $K$ internal conversion).
Although electrons coming from $2s$, $3s$ and $4s$ states ($L$, $M$ or $N$ internal conversions) have also a non-zero probability to undergo this process.
After the electron ejection, the hole in the corresponding shell is filled by an electron from a higher energy level, emitting characteristic $X$-rays, Auger electrons, or both.

For a given transition, the internal conversion coefficient of the electron in the $j$-shell, is defined by
\begin{equation}
\alpha_{j}=\frac{P_{IC, j}}{P_{\gamma}}\,,
\end{equation}
%% \begin{equation}
%% \alpha_{K}=\frac{P_{IC, K}}{P_{\gamma}}\,,
%% \end{equation}
where $P_{IC,j}$ is the $j$ conversion electron emission probability, and $P_{\gamma}$ is the $\gamma$-ray emission probability.
The total coefficient is
\begin{equation}
  \alpha_{T}=\sum_{j=K,L,M\cdots}\alpha_{j}\,.
\end{equation}
These coefficients are given in Tab.~\ref{tab:IC_prob}, for the $2.615$~MeV energy level of the \Tl\ decay scheme.
\begin{table}[!h]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    Emission probability (\%) & $\alpha_{K}$ (\%) & $\alpha_{L}$ (\%) & $\alpha_{M}$ (\%) & $\alpha_{T}$ (\%) \\
    \hline\hline
    $100$ & $0.1708$ &    $0.0292$ &  $0.00685$  &    $0.246$ \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Internal conversion coefficients for the $2.615$~MeV $\gamma$-ray of the \Tl\ decay scheme.
    \label{tab:IC_prob}}
\end{table}
Therefore, in $0.246$~\% of the cases, the \Pb\ excited nucleus will undergone an internal conversion corresponding to the $2.615$~MeV energy level.


\subsection{Selection of \Tl\ disintegrations in the 2e channel}

The \Tl\ can present a $2e$ electrons topology, when after the $\beta$ emission, an electron is ejected from the atom through internal conversion.
Especially, when this energy transfer corresponds to the $2.615$~MeV $\gamma$-ray, the ejected electron carry off a significant energy, depending on its initial binding energy with the nucleus.
An orbital electron from the $K$-shell is ejected with an energy $E_{IC,K}=2.526$~MeV, for instance.
In such a case, the \Tl\ disintegration can be identified in the $2e$ topology.
As one of the two electrons measured with a high energy, this decay is likely to contribute to the background of the $\zeronu$ of \Se, or even \Nd.
In Fig.~\ref{fig:Emin_Emax_Tl} is presented the individual energy spectra for $2e$ topologies for \Tl\ simulations inside the source foils.
\begin{figure}[!h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=13cm]{timedifference/fig_timediff/energy_spect_min_max_208Tl.pdf}
  \caption{Individual energy spectra for selected $2e$ topologies of \Tl\ decays simulated inside the source foils.

    Spectra are arbitrarily normalised.
    The [$2.7$;$3.2$] ROI is represented by grey dashed lines.
    \label{fig:Emin_Emax_Tl}}
\end{figure}
An usual technique to reject \Tl\ background consists in distinguishing $2e$ topologies for which one of the two calorimeter hit has an energy greater than $2.7$~MeV.
The energy resolution of the demonstrator being improved compared with the one of NEMO-$3$, this selection is efficient.
This cut-off allow to reject $0.61$~\% of the \Tl\ internal events, while rejecting only $0.11$~\% of $\zeronu$ events.

In the $2e$ channel, optimised topological cut-offs, based on time-of-flight computation and the distance between vertices, were presented in the previous chapter.
They are mostly efficient in rejecting the non-internal \Rn\ events.
In the next section, we remind and precise the internal probability computation, and present a new selection, also based on the time-of-flight computation, to reject the \Tl\ background.

\section{Rejection of \Tl\ with a time-of-flight criterion}
\label{sec:Tl_TOF}

\begin{itemize}
\item Un des deux gamma est retardé de 294 ps, puis conversion interne -> donner la proportion de retardés (nb d'ev attendus, dans la ROI)
\item Avant d'entrer dans le détail préciser le principe de la réjection par temps de vol.

  Ensuite dire que tu as quantifié le pourcentage d'électrons de haute énergie en retard avec une simulation "parfaite" i.e. avec une résolution en  temps  nulle.
  A comparer avec le chiffre donné précédemment (issu d'une étude du schéma de désintégration.)
\end{itemize}

%% Internal conversion occurs after $\beta$ or $\alpha$ radioactive decays leaving the nucleus excited.
%% Then a $\gamma$ particle is emitted and transfers its energy to an atomic electron which results in ejection of this electron from the atom.
%% The emitted electron has an energy corresponding to the energy of previously excited nucleus reduced by the electron binding energy.
%% After the internal conversion, electrons reorganise.
%% The hole in internal layer is filled by an electron from an external layer (emitting an X ray).\\
%% The probability for an atomic electron to be ejected decreases with the initial binding energy.
%% Thus, electrons from K layers have a higher probability to be converted (see Fig.~\ref{fig:Tl_IC}).

\subsection{The internal probability}

This tool, which aims to reject non-simultaneous events, is presented in detail in Chapter~\ref{ch:detector}.
As part of the analysis pipeline, it is widely employed in NEMO-$3$ and SuperNEMO, for background rejection purposes.
We examine an example of its usefulness in Chapter~\ref{ch:sensitivity}.
Nevertheless, for reasons to be given latter, in the current chapter, we need to perform our own calculation of internal probability, after the reconstruction pipeline.
That is an opportunity to come back to this tool and to clarify certain points.
The calculation of the internal $\chi^{2}$ is reminded in Eq.~\eqref{eq:int_chi2_electrons}, for two detected electrons, as a function of the expected times, $t^{\text{exp}}$, the experimentally measured times, $t^{\text{meas}}$, as well as the total uncertainty on the time measurement:
\begin{equation}
  \chi^{2}_{int}=\frac{((t^{\text{meas}}_{1} - t^{\text{exp}}_{1}) - (t^{\text{meas}}_{2} - t^{\text{exp}}_{2}))^{2}}{\sigma_{t_{1}}^{2}+\sigma_{t_{2}}^{2}+\sigma_{\beta_{2}}^{2}+\sigma_{\beta_{1}}^{2}+\sigma_{l_{1}}^{2}+\sigma_{l_{2}}^{2}}\,.
  \label{eq:int_chi2_electrons}
\end{equation}
The compenents of the total time uncertainty are brought by the calorimeter performance ($\sigma_{t_{i}}$), the uncertainty on particle energies ($\sigma_{\beta_{i}}$) and the uncertainty on track lengths ($\sigma_{l_{i}}$).
%%chap detecteur changer sigmas et t^th
%%ce chap vérifier notation steven sigma l
In the official SuperNEMO reconstruction pipeline, ${\sigma_{l}=\sigma_{l_{1}}=\sigma_{l_{2}}=70}$~ps for electrons.
As, therein chapter, we are predominantly focusing on the $2e$ channel to reject the \Tl\ background, we would optimise this parameter to describe accurately the internal events.

One way to examine if $\sigma_{l}$ is well-evaluated is to look at the flatness of the internal probability distribution for $\zeronu$ events in the $2e$ topology, for which a flat distribution is expected.
Indeed, the slope of this distribution provides pertinent information to check the estimation of uncertainties.
The flatter the distribution, the more correctly uncertainties are estimated.
We perform a lineal fit of the \Pint\ distribution on $[0.1;1]$, to avoid the peak at low internal probabilities, and we define the \emph{flatness parameter} $a_{F}$ as the slope of this fit.
The optimisation then consists in finding the value of $\sigma_{l}$ for which the parameter $a_{F}$ is cancelled.
We compute the \Pint\ distribution for simulations of $\zeronu$ decays inside the source foils.
We select merely $2e$ topologies by using the first order cuts, presented in Chapter~\ref{ch:sensitivity}, such that the internal hypothesis is almost certain to be verified.
In Fig.~\ref{fig:flatness} is given the slope $a_{F}$ as a function of $\sigma_{l}$.
\begin{figure}[!h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=13cm]{timedifference/fig_timediff/flatness.pdf}
  \caption{Slope $a_{F}$ as a function of the time uncertainty due to the reconstructed track length $\sigma_{l}$.
    The former value used in the SuperNEMO reconstruction pipeline is pointed out by blue dashed lines.
    The value kept for $\sigma_{l}$ is the one for which $a_{F}=0$, $\sigma_{l}~=~27.8~\pm~0.8$~ps, showed by purple dashed lines.
    The errors made on the $a_{F}$ fit parameter are represented by the grey filled area.
    \Pint\ is calculated for $\zeronu$ decays simulated inside the source foil, with first order cut-offs applied.
    \label{fig:flatness}}
\end{figure}
For $\sigma_{l}=70$~ps, $a_{F}>0$, revealing an overestimation of uncertainties in the computation of the internal $\chi^{2}$.
The optimised value, kept for the further analysis, is $\sigma_{l}~=~27.8~\pm~0.8$~ps.
In Fig.~\ref{fig:Pint_comparison} is displayed the internal probability distributions for two values of the $\sigma_{l}$ parameter: for the former value $\sigma_{l}=70$~ps and for the optimised value $\sigma_{l}=0.0278$~ns.
\begin{figure}[!h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=13cm]{timedifference/fig_timediff/Pint_comparison.pdf}
  \caption{Internal probability distributions for $\sigma_{l}=70$~ps (blue) and $\sigma_{l}=27.8$~ps (green).
    \Pint\ is calculated for $\zeronu$ decays simulated inside the source foil, with first order cut-offs applied.
    \label{fig:Pint_comparison}}
\end{figure}
Let us notice that normally $\sigma_{L}$ should depend on the track length as well as the energy, especially as multiple scattering in the tracker has a more notable impact for low energy electrons.
A more complete analysis would compare the simulated track lengths with the reconstructed ones, for different energy sets of mono-kinetic electrons.
Nevertheless, our optimisation is good enough for the current analysis.
We use this optimisation for the rest of this analysis, and discussion is in progress to modify this parameter in the SuperNEMO software.

The internal probability is principally designed to reject non-simultaneous events coming from the source foil.
Therefore, it is extremely effective in rejecting \Rn\ events produced far from the source foils.
The internal probability is however not suited for \Tl\ disintegrations occurring within the foils, because of the metastable state could delay significantly the electron with higher energy.
So we would set up a new law of probability that would express the hypothesis that a given event is an internal \Tl\ event.

\subsection{The exponential probability for \Tl\ events}

According to the disintegration scheme of the \Tl\ isotope (Fig.~\ref{fig:Tl_scheme}), there is an $81~\%$ probability of passing through the $294~$ps metastable level.
After that, to attain the ground state of \Pb, the excited nucleus has $100\%$ of probability to decay through the $2.615$ MeV energy level.
At this occasion, in $0.246\%$ of cases (Tab.~\ref{tab:IC_prob}), one of the orbital electrons is ejected from the atom following the internal conversion process.
To summarise, for $0.16$~\% of the total \Tl\ decays, a $\beta$ particle is emitted, and a delayed orbital electron is ejected through internal conversion of the $2.6$ MeV-$\gamma$.
We aim to use this delayed electron to discriminate \Tl\ internal background from the $\zeronu$ signal.

\subsubsection{Exponentially modified Gaussian}

For a given \Tl\ disintegration, we define the $\Delta t$ parameter as the difference of arrival time between the firstly emitted $\beta$ particle and the delayed IC electron.
Supposing SuperNEMO would perfectly measure the particles' times and energies, the $\Delta t$ probability density function would be an exponential, with the decay parameter $\tau=294$~ps.
We introduced in Chapter~\ref{ch:detector} the internal probability analysis tool.
At this occasion, let us described the components entering in the computation of the total uncertainty on time measurement for the SuperNEMO calorimeter.
To take into account measurement uncertainties, we define a Gaussian distribution centred around $\mu=0$, with a width set up by the $\sigma=\sigma_{tot}$ parameter, detailed in Eq.~\eqref{eq:sigma_tot}.
Therefore, to properly describe the $\beta$+IC delayed \Tl\ events, we have to convolve the exponential and the Gaussian distributions.

\subsubsection{Probability density function}

In Fig.~\ref{fig:Pexp} we show $E \otimes G(\tau,\mu,\sigma)$, the convolution of an exponential function and a Gaussian function.
\begin{figure}[!h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=13cm]{timedifference/fig_timediff/proba_expo.pdf}
  \caption{Normalised convolution distribution $E \otimes G (\tau,\mu,\sigma)$.
    The parameters are $\tau=294$~ps, $\mu=0$~ps and $\sigma=\sigma_{tot}$, computed with $\sigma_{l}=27.8$~ps and $\sigma_{t}=400$~ps.
    \label{fig:Pexp}}
\end{figure}
This density probability distribution corresponds to the case where the two detected electrons were emitted through the $\beta$+IC delayed process, given a certain total uncertainty $\sigma_{tot}$ on the arrival time measurement.
For our purpose, the parameter $\tau$ corresponds to the decay-time of $294$~ps of the \Tl\ metastable energy level.
The two parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma$ correspond to the mean and total uncertainty of the Gaussian function, respectively.
In our case, $\mu=0$~ps and the total uncertainty is calculated with $\sigma_{l}=27.8$~ps and $\sigma_{t}=400$~ps.
Each probability density function is unique and depends on the value of the measured energies for the two particles detected in the $2e$ topology.
In the given example, we considered two particles interacting inside the calorimeter with an energy of $1$~MeV each.
The $E \otimes G(\tau,\mu,\sigma)$ distribution is normalised.



\subsubsection{Exponential probability}

Once the probability density function is built for a given $2e$ event, we would define the probability $P_{e}$ that this event comes from a $\beta$+IC delayed decay.
We want to define the exponential probability following the same principle as for the internal probability, for comparison purposes.
Therefore, we would obtain the maximal value $P_{e}=1$ when the value of $\Delta t$ is the most favourable, i.e. when $\Delta t$ is of the order of the mean of the $E \otimes G (\tau,\mu,\sigma)$ distribution.
On the other hand, minimal values for $P_{e}$ would be reached for unfavourable values of $|\Delta t|$, so $P_{e} \xrightarrow[|\Delta t| \rightarrow +\infty]{} 0$.
Following these two requirements, the exponential probability is defined as
\begin{equation}
  P_{e} = \int_{-\infty}^{\Delta t_{1}} E \otimes G (\tau,\mu,\sigma)\, dx + \int_{\Delta t_{2}}^{-\infty} E \otimes G (\tau,\mu,\sigma)\, dx\,,
\end{equation}
where $\Delta t_{2}$ is one of the two primitives of $E \otimes G (\tau,\mu,\sigma)$ as $f(\Delta t_{1})=f(\Delta t_{2})$.[à changer]
These two integrals are represented by coloured areas in Fig.~\ref{fig:Pexp}.
The same way as internal probability, exponential probability distribution is expected to be flat for \Tl\ simulations on $]0;1]$.

In fig.~\ref{fig:Pexp_Tl} is presented an exponential probability distribution for \Tl\ and $\zeronu$ simulations inside the source foils, after first-order cut applied.

\end{itemize}


\section{Event selection}

The aim of this analysis is to set up a technique adapted to reject \Tl\ events.

\subsection{Energy selection}

The lower bound of the region of interest for the search of $\zeronu$ decay stands at the electron energy sum $2.7$~MeV.
From this energy, $2e$ topologies for \Tl\ are mainly populated by $\beta$ decays followed by the internal conversion of the $2.615$~MeV $\gamma$-ray.
In the following, we therefore focus only on events with a sum in energy of the two electrons greater than $2.7$~MeV.

\subsection{Arrival time cut-off}

We are especially focused on rejecting the internal \Tl\ events for which the successive $\gamma$-rays emmisions went through the $294$~ps half-life metastable state.
For these decays, we are expecting the particle of highest energy to be delayed compared with the one of lowest energy.
Therefore, we consider the two electron arrival times inside the calorimeter for a given $2e$ topology and we define the time difference between them as
\begin{equation}
\Delta t~=~t^{\text{meas}}_{1}-t^{\text{meas}}_{2}\,,
\end{equation}
where the time $t_{1}$ is the arrival time of the highest energy particle, and the time $t_{2}$ designates the other.
The time $t_{i}^{\text{meas}}$ it takes for a particle to reach the calorimeter depends on how long it took for it to exit the source foils after emission, as well as to travel through the wire chamber.
In order to remove from $\Delta t$ the dependency on travel time in the tracker, we define the corrected time difference as
\begin{align}
  \Delta t^{\text{corr}} & = t^{\text{corr}}_{1} - t^{\text{corr}}_{2}\\
  & = (t^{\text{meas}}_{1} - t^{\text{exp}}_{1}) - (t^{\text{meas}}_{2} - t^{\text{exp}}_{2})\,,
\end{align}
where $t^{\text{corr}}_{i}$ are the measured arrival times $t^{\text{meas}}_{i}$ corrected of the expected arrival times $t^{\text{exp}}_{i}$ calculated with the particle energy and track length.

The two distributions $\Delta t$ and $\Delta t^{\text{corr}}$ are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:delta_t}, for $\zeronu$ and \Tl\ simulations inside the source foils.

  The two distributions are normalised.
  $\sigma_{t}=400$~ps and $\sigma_{l}=27.8$~ps.
  \label{fig:delta_t}}
\end{figure}
For $\zeronu$ simulations, the $\Delta t$ distribution is centred around zero, as the two electrons are expected to be emitted simultaneously.
Then, the correction on time difference only lowers the standard deviation of the distribution.
For \Tl\ simulations, the mean of the $\Delta t$ distribution is slightly shifted towards positive values.
Once corrected by the expected times, the mean difference between the two electrons arrival times stands at $330~\pm~28$~ps.
This is a direct consequence of the existence of $\beta$+IC delayed events, for which the particle of highest energy is expected to hit a calorimeter block at a time $t^{\text{corr}}_{1}~>~t^{\text{corr}}_{2}$.
Therefore, a simple way of rejecting the \Tl\ delayed events is to consider the sign of $\Delta t^{\text{corr}}$: these events are more likely to have $\Delta t^{\text{corr}}~>~0$.
A simple cut-off consist in rejecting $2e$ topologies for which $\Delta t^{\text{corr}}~>~0$.

For an calorimeter time uncertainty of $\sigma_{t}~=~400$~ps, we are able to reject $67$~\% of \Tl\, while selecting $50$~\% of the $\zeronu$, for the $2e$ topologies with $E~>~2.7$~MeV.
Although we manage to reject a significant fraction of Thallium events, the impact of this cut is too high on $\zeronu$ events.
We study in Sec.~\ref{subsec:selection_optimisation} an optimization of this cut-off, including the influence of the temporal performance of the calorimeter $\sigma_{t}$.

\subsection{Probability cut-off}

One of the main drawback of the cut on $\Delta t^{\text{corr}}$ presented is that is does not take into account the uncertainties on time measurements.
Two analysis tools were presented in Sec.~\ref{sec:Tl_TOF}.
The first one, called internal probability, was already used in Chapter~\ref{ch:sensitivity}, and is a widely-used tool to reject non-simultaneaous events, taking into account these uncertainties.
The second was designed specifically for this analysis to identify delayed \Tl\ events, and also depends on the uncertainties through the convolution with a Gaussian function.

A useful way of reprensenting the probability cut-off is to display a two-dimensional binned histogram of $P_{e}$ as a function of \Pint, as done is Fig.~\ref{fig:biplot_Pexp_Pint}.
\begin{figure}[!h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=15cm]{timedifference/fig_timediff/PintVSPexp_208Tl.eps}
  \caption{Two-dimensional histogram showing the $P_{e}$ distribution as a function the \Pint\ distribution, for \Tl\ simulations.

    The first-order cut-off and the energy selection $>2.7$~MeV have been applied.
    \label{fig:biplot_Pexp_Pint}}
\end{figure}
We clearly distinguish three event populations in this histogram.
In order to better understand the variations in this histogram, we give in Fig.~\ref{fig:proba_cut_ex} three examples of $E~\otimes~G$ distributions, one for each of the three zones.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \Pint$\in[0;1]$ and $P_{e}\in[0;0.65]$ (Fig.~\ref{subfig:Proba_cut_1}):\\
  This region corresponds to events for which $\Delta t^{\text{corr}}<0$.
  As the internal $\chi^{2}$ distribution is symmetrical, such events can have a value of \Pint\ varying from $0$ to $1$.
  Small values of \Pint\ correspond to events with a large $\Delta t^{\text{corr}}$ in absolute value.
  Conversely, the exponential distribution is not centred in zero.
  Therefore, if we limit to events for which the time difference is negative, we reach an upper bound for the value of the integral ($0.65$ in that case).
  This bound directly depends on the variations of the exponential distribution, therefore to $\sigma_{t}$.
\item \Pint$\in[0;0.65]$ and $P_{e}\in[0;1]$ (Fig.~\ref{subfig:Proba_cut_2}):\\
  These events have positive values for $\Delta t^{\text{corr}}$, beyond the $E~\otimes~G$ distribution maximum.
  The smaller the value of \Pint, the lower the probability that both particles were emitted at the same time into the source.
  Besides, for values of $\Delta t^{\text{corr}}$ highly positives, the value of the exponential probability can reach high values, up to $1$.
  The larger the value of $\Delta t^{\text{corr}}$ in positives, the smaller the value of $P_{e}$.
\item \Pint$\in[0.65;1]$ and $P_{e}\in[0.65,1]$ (Fig.~\ref{subfig:Proba_cut_3}):\\
  This region is alse populated by events for which $\Delta t^{\text{corr}}>0$.
  Unlike the previous case, these events have small $\Delta t^{\text{corr}}$ values, meaning above the maximum of the exponential distribution.
  Also, these events have high internal probability values, as the probability that these two particles were emitted simultaneously is high.
  In the same way as the first item, the value of the integral is bounded: the lower bound corresponds to the value of the integral when $\Delta t^{\text{corr}}=0$ (here $0.65$).
  Once again, this bound is deeply related to the value considered for $\sigma_{t}$.
  The exponential probability can be equal to $1$ when $\Delta t^{\text{corr}}$ reaches the maximum of the exponential distribution.
\end{enumerate}
Therefore, the exponential probability not only tests the hypothesis that a detected event corresponds to delayed thallium, but also, as with internal probability, quantifies the probability that two particles were emitted simultaneously from the source foils.

As we want to descriminate signal $\zeronu$ from delayed \Tl\ events, we reject $2e$ topologies for which $P_{e}~>~$\Pint\ (this cut-off is also represented in Fig.~\ref{fig:biplot_Pexp_Pint}).
With the previous explanation, we understand that such a cut is strongly linked to the cut on $\Delta t^{\text{corr}}$ presented in the previous sub-section.
For $\sigma_{t}=400$~ps, we are able to reject $60$\% of \Tl, while selecting $58$\% of $\zeronu$ $2e$ topologies for which $E>2.7$~MeV.
Although we are able to keep more $\zeronu$ events with this probability cut-off than for the one on arrival time difference, this level is still not satisfying.
Moreover, at first glance, this cut-off is less efficient than the $\Delta t$ cut-off in rejecting \Tl\ events.
However, it is much more interesting to consider a cut on event probability rather than a simple $\Delta t$ cut, because the time measurement uncertainties are taken into account.

In the next sub-section, we review how these two cut-offs can be optimised in order to improve the \Tl\ rejection, while keeping a great part of signal events.
The final goal is to find optimal cut-offs in order to maximise the $90$\% CL limit set on $\Tbeta$.

\begin{itemize}
\item relier le point d'inflexion du biplot à ce que l'on voit sur la fig eff 0nu / rej Tl
\item Donner le nb d'ev rejeté sur le nb d'ev total, puis sur le nb d'ev retardés
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item cut efficiencies (delta t et proba) on other backgrounds
\item Se servir des résultats de $\sigma_{t}$ trouvés au chap.~\ref{chap:Cobalt_study}
\item Mais dire que ces sigmas peuvent être améliorés
\item donc présenter l'évolution des résultats (efficacité de réjection et sensibilité) sur la réjection en fonction de la valeur de sigma t, à faire varier dans un certain range.
\item Tu pourrais avec une figure à 2D où tu montres l'efficacité relative 0nu (égale à 100\% avant cette coupure temporelle) en fonction de la réjection du Tl208 -> cela donne une courbe que tu parcoures et tu cherches à optimiser ton point de fonctionnement.

\section{Conclusions}

\begin{itemize}
\item On peut éventuellement mettre une source de 232U dans le détecteur (un des parents de 208Tl) pour tester la réjection.
\item ajout sélection énergie
\item plus correct de couper sur Pexp que sur delta t car on tient compte des erreurs
\end{itemize}
